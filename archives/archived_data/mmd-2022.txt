\, Acknowledgements - We are extremely grateful to Elain Hodges (Smithsonian Institution) for
preparing the artwork in the first edition of this book, and to Karolyn Darrow (Smithsonian
Institution) for preparing the revised and updated digital artwork, including line drawings and
habitus photos. Rachel Fordyce (Cornell University) helped immensely with editing and
formatting of keys and other materials. For color habitus photos, we thank Jakob Musafia,
Claudia Ratti and particularly Liam Graham (York University). Their work was financially
supported by Cecily and Robert Bradshau,, to whom we are extremely grateful. Jerry Rozen,
Achik Dorchin, Felipe Freitas, Rodrigo Gongalves, and Maurizio Femandez generously provided
taxonomic expertise on certain groups. We are grateful to the instructors and students at the Bee
Course, a ten-day workshop on bee systematics, biology, and ecology that has been offered at the
Southwestern Research Station since 1999, for their ongoing contributions to this work. We are
exceptionally grateful to Charles D. Michener for developing the concept, framework, original
keys, and associated background material for this book, and for his immense contributions to the
field of bee systematics, evolution, and taxonomy. vChapter I -- The importance of bees
o describe why bees are so important ecologically in both natural and agricultural habitats
o mention the uptick in interest due to the 200712008 CCD crisis
o describe the blossoming of interest in non-managed and wild bees in the importance of
being able to identifu bees for biotic survey work
o mentioned economic value of wild bees to crop pollination
o mention PCAM and the Bee Course as two major drivers for development of this booko mention Empire State Native Pollinator Survey and the Oregon State Bee Atlas - and
other state-wide efforts
o mention USDA-RCN project on national bee survey
o endangered bees - importance of identifzing them
o mention how fascinating bees are including their close association with flowing plants
(and host-plant specialization), brood parasitic bees, diversity in nesting biology, range of
social behaviors, and their ecological associations with other organisms (mites,
nematodes, and other insects) Chapter 2 - The scope and use of this book
o explain geographic scope and include map; include Orr et al.202l map of species
richness in N. America?
o mention how many species and genera occur in our area (referring to Table 1; perhaps
also make a figure summarizing species richness across subfamilies)
o describe how to use the keys, locators, etc. - indicate that it would be a good idea to put a
post-it note flagging the start of each sub-key (chapters 7-10)
o explain the importance of understanding morphology and recommend that readers use the
chapter on bee morphology (Chapter 4) to learn these key terms.
o describe what to do once you have identified a bee to genus; resources for species-level
identification (see'Notes on the Genera"); including (1) revisions, (2) online keys
(Discover Life, Terry's key to megachilid genera, etc.)
o also mention how the book has changed from the earlier edition
o send reader to Sam Droege's The Very Hand,v Manual for information on collecting
techniques, pinning and specimen preparation
o mention other resources as well: The Bees in Your Backltard (Wilson & Carril 2015),
Common Bees of Eastern North America (Carril & Wilson 2021)

vChapter 3 -- The changing view of bee phylogeny and classification
o outline how bee phylogeny has changed through improved methods and additional
(mostly molecular) data sets
o describe our new view of bee origins from crabronid wasps
o describe the family level phylogeny of bees and how it has changed over timeo discuss the relationships among subfamilies within the seven farnilies (including
phylogenies at the subfamily level)
o go family by family and outline what has changed in the classification -- new
subfamilies, placement of tribes and genera, elevation/removal of genera and subgenera
[mention Lasioglossum as an example of one genus that has undergone significant change
at the subgeneric and generic levels]; also highlight massive changes in Apidae
o highlight challenges and controversies with Megachile (many genera or just one) and
Andrena and the massive number of paraphyletic subgenera (Pisanti et aL.2020)

Sample text: No other family of bees has undergone as much change in the classification as the
family Apidae (as currently construed). In the first edition of this book we recognized two
families: Apidae (including the four corbiculate bees [Euglossini, Bombini, Meliponini, and
Apini]) and "Anthophoridae", which included all the remaining groups. In the 1990's
morphological studies by Roig-Alsina and Michener (1993) revealed that the corbiculate bees
arise from within the group referred to as "Anthophoridae". This rendered the "Anthophoridae" a
paraphyletic group and modern systematic classifications prefer to recognize only monophyletic
groups (i.e., groups that include all the descendants of single common ancestor). Roig-Alsina and
Michener (1993) chose to expand Apidae to include all the subfamilies, tribes, and genera previously placed in "Anthophoridae" and they recognized three subfamilies: Apinae (expanded
to include the four corbiculate tribes as well as many others formerly in "Anthophoridae"),
Nomadinae (an exclusively brood-parasitic group), and Xylocopinae (the allodapine and
carpenter bees). But the story does not end there. Subsequent molecular and morphological
studies (Cardinal et al. 2010) revealed that many tribes of brood parasites that were considered
part of Apinae (provide list) were, in fact, closely related to the brood parasites in the subfamily
Nomadinae. Furthermore, both Nomadinae and Xylocopinae rendered Apinae paraphyletic.
Bossert et al. (2018) fuither resolved relationships in Apidae and provided what is now the
current classification recognizing five, rnonophyletic subfamilies of Apidae (Anthophorinae,
Nomadinae, Eucerinae, Apinae, and Xylocopinae ).v

vChapter 4 - A primer on bee morphology
lupdated 6/28/20221
In order to use the keys in this book effectively, it is important to become familiar with
the morphology of bees and the terms used to describe morphological features. With that goal in
mind, we present below an overview of bee morphology and an introduction to the terms that are
used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based
on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener's PhD thesis (Michener 1944).
Additional key papers on bee morphology include Urban (1967), Camargo et al. (1967),
Eickwort (1969), Stephen et al. (1969), and Brooks (1988). The illustrations in this chapter are
redrawn from Michener (1944 and 1965a) and Danforth (1996). For a detailed look at the
internal and external anatomy of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), see Snodgrass ( 1956). For a
comprehensive and modern overview of general insect morphology, see Beutel et al. (2014).
BODY REGIONS
Before diving into the details, let's consider a basic question. What do we call the three
body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,
thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and
mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been
reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (: Hymenoptera
with a nalrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narow "waist" is actually a constriction between abdominal segments 7 and2.

p(lsloccipullrypostoma
clypeus area proboscidial fbssa
mandible lahrurn
Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
"mesosoma" (: thorax plus first abdominal segment, or "propodeum"; Fig. l3) and "metasoma"
(: remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,
mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover
those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the intemal organs plus genitalia.
For use of the keys, it will be important to identiSz specific metasomal terga or stema. To do so,ut antennal we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the
first metasoma tergum is T I , the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first
metasomal sternum is S1, the second 52, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are
comfortable with identiflring specific metasomal terga and stema when you start using the keys.
The sexes in bees are often quite different from one
another, and in parts of the keys the sexes are treated
separately. To people familiar with bees, males and females
can be distinguished most rapidly based on the overall shape
of the body - males are typically more slender than females
and they often have longer antennae. Also, the presence of a
distinct scopa will distinguish females from males in many
groups (excluding brood parasites, bees that carry pollen
internally, and queens of advanced eusocial species). Finally,
females have stings, and males have male genitalia [Fig. 20];
but both are commonly retracted, and in some fernales the
sting is rudimentary. Other features may need to be examined
to verify the sex of an individual, including the number of
antennal segments and the number of visible metasomal
segments. Males have l3 antennal segments (12 in Neopasites
and Holcopasites); females have 12 [Fig. 10]. In addition,
males and females typically differ in the number of visible
metasomal segments. In males, we can usually count seven
visible metasomal terga, whereas in females we can usually
count only six [Fig. 19]. But keep in mind that the last
segment, which often bears a pygidial plate, can be hidden. In
female Halictinae, for example, T6 is often hidden beneath
T5, so females appear to have just five visible terga. Likewise,
in some male bees it is difficult to see T7 because it is largely,
or rarely wholly, hidden beneath T6. In addition, in males of
some groups (e.9., Osrniini) the segments are greatly
telescoped and retracted so that the visible terga and sterna
can be reduced to as few as four visible stema and terga.cp.!sromaloeell

HEAD CAPSULE (Figs 2-4, 10)
The malar area [Fig. 2] is the space between the eye and the mandible; its length is the
shortest distance from the eye to the mandible [Fig. 4);the width of this area is the width of the
base of the mandible. The foveae (singular: fovea) of the face [Fig. 2] and of the sides of the
second metasomal tergum (T2) are shallow depressions, usually black in color, with a texture
distinct from the surrounding cuticle, and variable in shape. The term orbit is often used for the
eye margin, inner orbit for the frontal or facial margin, and outer orbit for the genal margin. The
genal area is the region behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge [Figs. 3 and 4]. The
ridge surrounding the concave posterior surface of the head above and laterally is called the
preoccipital ridge [Fig. 3]. A carina sometimes found on this rid-ee is the preoccipital carina. The v

\,proboscidial fossa is the large, deep groove on the
underside of the head into which the proboscis
folds [Fig.3].
MOUTHPARTS (Figs. 5-9)
Bee mouthparts consist of paired mandibles
for chewing and a proboscis that can fold and
unfold for lapping and sucking nectar. For the
names of mandibular structures [Fig. 5], we usually
follow Michener and Fraser (1978). For simplicity
we often refer to preapical teeth on the upper8

margin instead of teeth of the pollex. Other terms used herein are the condylar ridge, which
arises near the mandibular condyle and extends toward the apex of the mandible, and the outer
ridge, which is the next ridge above the condylar ridge on the outer surface of the mandible.
The bee proboscis is a complex stnrcture formed from a fusion of the maxilla and labium,
which together make up the "labiomaxillary complex." The maxilla consists of paired cardines
(singular: cardo) that suspend the labiomaxillary complex from beneath the head capsule, the
stipes, blade-like galea $lural: galeae), and the maxillary palpus (plural: palpi) with up to six
segments [Figs. 6,7). Attached at the apex of the
cardines is the labium, which consists of the lorum,
mentum, prementum, tongue-like glossa, and (typically)
four-segmented labial palpus [Fig. 6]. In Colletidae the
glossa is quite different from that of other bees [Fig. 8,
9]. Rather than being slender and elongate, as in most
other bee families, the colletid glossa is short and
bilobed (sometimes referred to as "bifid"). This
modification of the glossa is related to the application of
the thick, cellophane brood cell lining that characterizes
colletid bees (Batra 1980).
Bees can be divided into two broad categories
based on mouthpart morphology: short-tongued bees
(Andrenidae, Hal i cti dae, C oll etidae, Stenotritidae, and
Melittidae), in which the labial palpal segments are all
similar in morphology (Fig. 8), and long-tongued bees
(Apidae and Megachilidae), in which the first two labial
palpal segments are slender and blade-like (Fig. 6).
Danforth et al. (2019) provide a more detailed
description of the proboscis and how it functions.
The proboscis is typically folded beneath the
head capsule, making it very difficult to distinguish
among the complex and interconnected elements.
However, if the mouthparts are pulled before pinning, while the specimen is still flexible, the
individual elements can be easily recognized. In some cases? it is necessary to examine the
maxillary and labial palpi and to count the number of palpal segments (e.g., in certain Eucerini).
It can also be useful to be able to identifiz the blade-like, first two labial palpal segments in long-labial palpus

tongued bees as a tool for knowing whether you are examining a short-tongued or long-tongued
bee. But this is by no means essential for using the keys to the genera. Chapter l1 (Key to the
Farnilies of North and Central America), however, makes heavy use of mouthpart characters
because these characters are defining features of the bee families.
MESOSOMA (Figs. 11-18)
The mesosoma is a compact structure consisting of sclerites of the pro-, meso- and
metathoracic segments, which bear the legs and wings, and the first true abdominal segment,
termed the propodeum [Figs. 13 and 14]. The prothorax in bees is represented primarily by the
large pronotum, which extends laterally and meets ventrally behind the forecoxae, forming a
tubelike structure. The pronotal lobe is a useful landmark, and its shape and location may be used
in generic identification. The mesothorax and metathorax bear the wings and the second and
third pairs of legs. In dorsal view [Fig. 14], the mesothorax can be divided into four distinct
sclerites: the scutum, the scutellum, and paired axillae. Dorsally, the metathorax consists of a
single sclerite, the metanotum. Laterally [Fig. 13], the mesothorax is represented by the
mesepisternum, sometimes referred to as the mesopleuron. The mesepisternum is sometimes
divided by the pre-episternal groove into the pre-episternum (or pre-episternal area) and the rest
of the mesepistemum. The shape and location of the pre-epistemal groove, the scrobal groove,
and the scrobe are often important in generic identification. The metepisternum (or metapleuron)
forms the lateral surface of the metathorax. The wing bases are located above the upper margins
of the mesepisternum and the metepisternum.

The form and subdivisions of the propodeum are not easy to illustrate but are exceedingly
important for identification. Many bees have a pair of impressed lines on the propodeum,
beginning near the anterior dorsolateral parts of the propodeum and extending downward and
posteromesially and nearly rneeting in the propodeal pit [Fig. 149], a median depression of the
lower posterior surface. These lines, together with the anterior dorsal margin of the propodeum,
enclose the triangular area, or propodeal triangle [Fig. 1a9]. Morphologically, this triangle is the
metapostnotum (Brothers 1976). The shape of the propodeum as seen in profile is quite
independent of the triangle. The whole propodeum may be vertical or nearly so, dropping from
the posterior margin of the metanotum. In this case it is termed declivous. However, as in Fig.
13, there may be a more or less horizontal basal region. In Fig. 1 3 it is separated by a sharp line, \,
V
v
v
\,
v
\,
\,
vor carina, from the declivous posterior surface. When such is the case, the horizontal part is
called the basal zone, or basal area, ofthe propodeum [Fig. 1 3]. It is part ofthe propodeal
triangle. The term "basal area" is applicable even if no
sharp line separates the horizontal from the vertical
surfaces. In some bees the two surfaces are continuously
rounded, one onto the other in a broad curving surface; in
that case the term "basal area" is not definable unless there
is distinctive surface sculpturing.
Wings are illustrated, and the veins labeled, in
Figs. 15 and 16, using a modified Comstock and Needham
system. Because the homologies of the veins are not very
certain, as well as because some comparable-looking veins
have very different morphological names, it has seemed
best to continue the use of some terms that are
morphologically noncommittal for certain cells and veins
heavily used in taxonomy. The names of cells and certain
noncommittal names for veins are shown in Figs. 17 and
18.
Of special importance are three veins that all look
like crossveins: the second abscissa of Rs (or first
transverse cubital), first r-m (or second transverse cubital),
and second r-m (or third transverse cubital), to use the
Comstock and Needham system. These veins help to
define the submarginal cells, which are usually either
three or two in number. It is important to note that
submarginal cells can be variable within species. While

are developmental anomalies that can result in non-
typical pattems of wing venation. Scarpulla (2018)
identified a number of such wing vein anomalies in
species of Colletidae, Andrenidae, Halictidae and
Apidae. These wing vein anomalies are commonly
expressed as a loss ofthe second transverse cubital vein
in which a bee species that typically has three
submarginal cells instead has two. In some cases individuals can have normal wing venation on
one side of the body and non-typical wing venation on the other. If you suspect you have a
specimen with such a wing vein anomaly, the best solution is to compare it to other individuals
of the same species to verifu what is the "normal" pattem.
Wings are described as though spread, so that the direction toward the costal margin
(where the stigma is in the forewing) is called anterior; toward the wing apex, distal. To save
space, the word stigma is used in place of pterostigma [Fig. 15].
The jugal and vannal lobes of the hind wing are both measured from the wing base to the
apices of the lobes. Thus, on Fig. 18 one might say that the jugal lobe is about two-thirds as long
as the vannal.vannal lobelnr-cu
i
LUI Some authorities advocate a system for identifoing parts of legs that assumes that all legs
are pulled out laterally at right angles to the long axis of the body. Although we appreciate the
logic of that system, we follow the more traditional system in which the legs are considered to be
in their normal positions. Thus, we consider the corbicula of Apidae [Fig. 22]to be on the outer,
not the anterior, surface of the hind tibia, and we consider the two hind tibial spurs to be outer
and inner, not anterior and posterior.
The tibial spurs are the movable inferior apical spurs on the tibiae; the tibial spines are
immovable, sharp, superior, apical projections, usually srnall in size, found in some bees (see
Fig. I 1 and Michener 1944). Description of the tibial spurs is important in many bees; this is
especially so of the inner hind tibial spur. This spur usually has two toothed margins. It is the
inner one that is commonly elaborated in various ways. It may be finely or coarsely serrate.
Following custom, we have described this margin as ciliate if it has slender, almost hairlike
projections (usually numerous), although in many cases the appearance is like that of a fine
comb. Also following custom, we have described a spur as pectinate if its inner margin is
produced into a few long, coarse, often blunt projections [Fig. 154], even though the number of
such projections is in some cases reduced to only two or three.
The basitibial plate is a plate on the outer side of the
base of the hind tibia of many bees fFigs. 11, 174, and 175],
presumably important for support as bees move up or down
their burrows in the soil. Commonly it is surrounded by a
carina or a sharp line of some sort and has vestiture (if any)
different from that of adjacent regions, but it may be
indicated only by a series of tubercles, or even by a single
tubercle, and in some cases (as in Xylocopa) its apex is
represented by a structure near the middle of the tibia.
On the inner surface of the hind tibia of most bees is
an area of variable size covered with hairs of uniform length,
usually blunt or briefly bifid. These are called keirotrichia.
Between the tarsal claws there is often a protruding,
pad-like arolium (plural: arolia) [Fig. 12]. The arolium can
be lacking in some taxa, such as Megachile, Ptilothrix,
Euglossini, and Centridini.
The scopa (plural: scopae) is the pollen-carrying
brush of hairs. If such hairs surround a space in which pollen
is carried, they are said to form a corbicula. The best known
corbicula is on the outer side of the hind tibia of Apidae, butt9

('{'{!'

other corbiculae are on the underside of the hind femur of Andrenidae, Halictidae, Colletidae,
and others and on the side of the propodeum of many species of Andrena. In most bees the scopa
is on the hind legs, but in Megachilidae and some others it is on the underside of the metasoma.
Scopae are, of course, found only on nonparasitic females; in the keys, we do not state this fact
in every case. Scopae are absent in parasitic bees, in all male bees, in queens of highly social
bees, and in Hylaeus. v

\,METASOMA (Figs. t9-22)
Each metasomal tergum or stemum (except for the anteriormost and the reduced apical
ones) consists of a plate commonly marked by some transverse lines, as follows: (1) Across the
anterior margin, always completely hidden in the intact metasoma, is the antecosta. (2) Basal to
the middle of each plate is anothertransverse line, the gradulus (plural: graduli; Fig. l9). The
ends of the tergal graduli, unless bent strongly to the rear, are usually near the spiracles. If bent
strongly to the rear, the resultant longitudinal lines are called lateral parts or lateral arms of the
graduli or, if carinate, lateral gradular carinae. The area anterior to the gradulus is usually at a
slightly higher level than that posterior to it, so that the gradulus is like a minute step. The
elevated, pre-gradular area provides a smooth surface for the anterior tergum or sternum to move
across as the metasoma moves and changes shape. The graduli are often concealed on the intact
metasoma but, especially on the second tergum and sternum, are sometimes exposed. (3) Near
the posterior margin of each tergum and stemum is usually another transverse line, the
premarginal line, separating the posterior marginal area from the rest of the sclerite. This area is
often depressed but in other cases differs only in sculpturing from the area basal to it.
The pygidial plate [Fig. l9] is a usually flat plate, commonly surrounded by a carina or a
line and in some cases produced as an apical projection, on T6 of females or T7 of males. The
prepygidial fimbria is a dense band of hairs across the apex of T5 of females. It is conspicuously
different from, usually denser than, the apical hair bands or fasciae of preceding terga. Dense
hairs on T6 of females, on each side of the pygidial plate, constitute the pygidial fimbria [Fig.

The genital capsule [Fig. 20] as well as 57 and S8
[Figs. 21,22) of male bees exhibit many diagnostic characters
and may be dissected out for study (in fact, for some groups,
species-level identifications may require examination of male
57, 58 or the genital capsule). In some groups the sixth, fifth,
and even the fourth stema are also hidden and modified. On a
freshly relaxed specimen it is usually possible to reach between the apical exposed tergum and
sternum and, with a hooked needle, pull out the genitalia and hidden stema. In most cases such dissection is not difficult, but in the Megachilidae the numerous hidden stema are firmly
connected to one another and to the terga laterally and are often delicate medially, so that
successful dissection may be difficult. Beginners should start with other groups.
For gross observations, sterna and genitalia may be preserved dry, glued to a card on the
pin with the specimen. For more detailed study, they should be immersed in a solution of l}Yo
sodium or potassium hydroxide to remove the muscle tissue, then washed in water, and placed
for study in glycerin, and transferred for preservation to microvials, kept with the specimen by
running the pin through the stopper. Preservation on slides has the disadvantage of making side
views impossible, as well as crushing the genitalia, which are often quite thick. \,

vChapter 5 - Locators for the Key to the Genera
lupdated 6/24/20221
For people new to bee identification, Chapter 6 (Key to the Genera) may appear forbiddingly
long. We therefore provide eight locators to help bypass portions of the main key and thus
facilitate identifications. Not all bees agree with any of the initial locator statements; those that
do not should be run from the beginning of Chapter 6 (Key to the Genera).
Each numbered locator begins with a statement. A bee agreeing with that statement can be run
through the locator key (with lettered couplets) following that statement. The locator key leads to
numbered couplets of the main key or to particular genera. Thus, specimens that agree with the(A, [grnalcJ 'n3) |
initial statement of any of the locators can be identified relatively quickly
only for females. Locators 6-8 work for both sexes.. Locators 1-5 function
The following is a list of the locators:
l. Outer surface of female hind tibia with a usually flat or concave, shining, and largely hairless
area surrounded by fringes to form a corbicula [F|g.22].
2. Ventral surface of female metasoma with scopa of pollen-carrying hairs [Fig. 23]; hind leg
without scopa; two submarginal cells [Fig. 25].
3. Scopa of pollen-carrying hairs extensively developed on hind femur [Fig. 26], frequently on
tibia as well (commonly also on trochanter), and forming a corbicula on underside of
femur.
4. Scopa of pollen-carrying hairs well developed on hind tibia (but not forming a corbicula),
reduced or absent on hind femur and trochanter fFig.271.
5. Scopa absent in females (on both hind legs and metasomal sterna) [mostly brood parasitic
beesl.
6. Basal vein of forewing strongly arcuate or subangulate near base [Fig. 28]; T5 of females
(except in parasitic genera) with longitudinal median zone or triangular area of short,
dense hairs, or minute, dense punctation (and sometimes with a slit) dividing the
prepygidial fimbria lFig.29); T6 of females ordinarily completely hidden by T5.
7. Arolia absent [compare Figs. 30 and 31].

\,Chapter 12 -- Notes on the genera
lupdated 07/08/22 BND JLN
The notes below are intended to supplement the keys in that they should help the user decide
whether they have successfully identified a specimen to genus. The notes are organized
according to the classification of bee genera presented in Table 2-1. The brief family
characterizations, as well as the "Key to the Families," are probably accurate for our area but not
necessarily worldwide. For a worldwide treatment of genera, see Michener (2007).
DESCRIPTIVE TERMS. For each genus, there are comments on appearance and sometimes on
distinguishing features other than those noted in the keys. General body shape is described in
terms (listed below) such that with a single word a person who knows a few common bee genera
can get an idea of what an unknown genus looks like. Body forms are best appreciated in dorsal
view. Additional comments on color and pilosity are added to the descriptions below, where
useful.
andreniform-body form of Andrena [Figs. 421-424], Halictus fFigs. 439 and 440), or Colletes
[Fig. al7]. Male often more slender, with more parallel-sided metasoma, than female.
anthophoriform-body form of Anthophora lFrgs.473 and 4741. Robust, with head and
mesosoma hairy, enhancing the aspect of robustness; metasoma beyond first segment usually
with little erect hair.
apiform-body form of workers of Apis mellifera [Fig. 507]. That is, more robust than
andreniform and more slender than euceriform.
bombiform-body form of Bombus fFigs 508 and 5091. Like anthophoriform but metasoma
with much erect hair, like mesosoma.
epeoliform-body form of Epeolus or Triepeolus [Fig. a93]. Somewhat more robust than
Nomada but nonetheless wasplike parasitic bees; scopa absent; body often with areas of short,
pale pubescence forming a conspicuous pattern.
euceriform-body form of Melissodes fFigs. 481 and 482]. Similar to anthophoriform but
somewhat less robust.
heriadiform-body form of Hoplitis fFig. 471), Heriades [Figs. 469 and 470f, or Megachile
(Chelostomoides) [Fig. a65]. Similar to megachiliform but more slender, metasoma parallel
sided.
hylaeiform-body form of l/ylaeus lFig.420]. Slender, hairs inconspicuous without
magnification, scopa inconspicuous or absent.
megachiliform-body form of Megachile (Megachile) fFigs. 463 and 464), Osmia [Fig. 472], or
Dianthidiun lFig.457l.Heavy body, thick head, metasoma rather wide, not parallel sided. nomadiform-body form of Nomada [Figs. 498 and 499]. Slender, wasplike, not noticeably
hairy, often with yellow or red markings or entirely red or yellow; scopa absent.
trigoniform-body form of Trigona [Fig. 519] and its relatives. Metasoma small or slender;
body not conspicuously hairy, that is, hairs short and metasoma usually shiny.
Many bees do not fall unequivocally into one of the above categories. Much of a
specimen's appearance depends on how full the crop was when the specimen was killed, how
much the metasoma has telescoped in drying, and so forth. Nonetheless, we think that these
terms may be useful to give an idea of the characteristic aspect of a genus.
CONTENT OF THE NOTES. The notes and keys give characteristics of species within our area,
which is America north of the Colombia-Panama border, including the Antilles (i.e., North
America). Extralimital species may not agree with all characters listed. Under each family,taxa
are aranged according to Table 2-1, which provides a complete classification at the family,
subfamily, tribal, and generic levels. For more detailed information on each genus as well as
additional taxonomic notes on the subgenera, see Michener (2007).
In most bees the integument is black. If it is extensively colored otherwise (e.g., red,
yellow, or metallic blue or green), it is noted. Hairiness, when mentioned, refers to long hairs,
giving a more robust and fuzzy aspect, unless otherwise indicated.
For each genus, after listing some morphological characteristics, the notes give a
subjective idea of abundance, based on collecting experience. In Table 2-l we provide an
estimate of the number of species in our area (Canada, United States, Mexico, Guatemala,
Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and the Greater and Lesser
Antilles) based on information provided in Ascher and Pickering2020 (Discover Life:
irttps:i,irvu'*'.discoverlife.orgimpr'20q?search:Apoidea lnote vet sion and date in final draftl).
Next, the notes indicate the range (and sometimes habitat) of the genus within our area,
including a rough indication of the more extensive neotropical range, if applicable, followed by a
parenthetical notation if the range is more extensive-for example, holarctic or cosmopolitan.
The word Mesoamerica as used here means Mexico and Central America, including Panama.
The word tropical is frequently used and refers to lowland areas, usually moist or mesic, in
Mesoamerica. Additional details on the biogeography of each genus can be found in Michener
(2007).
Most bees are solitary, that is, with one female per nest, and the nests are burrows in the
ground made by the bees (Danforth et al.2019} Sometimes nests occur in large and dense
aggregations, but the bees are nonetheless considered solitary. Notation is made of genera that
include some species or populations that are social, either cooperatively breeding or eusocial (as
defined in Danforth et al. 2019) or that nest in different sites or substrates. Nests are unknown for
certain genera. A review of known immature stages was made by McGinley (1989) but larval
bees from additional genera have since been described by Rozen and others.
Many groups of solitary bees are host-plant specialists (also referred to as "oligolectic"
bees), meaning they visit a small group of closely related host-plants for pollen. For these
specialist groups we list the likely host-plant genera and families upon which they specialize. For
"oil bees", bees that collect floral oils for brood cell lining and pollen provisions, we also list the
floral hosts that serve as a source for the oils as well as morphological modifications associated
with oil collecting.v

vBrood parasites, also called cuckoo bees or cleptoparasites, have no pollen-harvesting or
pollen-carrying structures. Brood parasites enter nests of their hosts, lay eggs in the host cells,
and leave (Danforth et aL.2019). In most cases, brood parasitic females oviposit in open cells
but, in some genera, females open previously closed cells. Adults or larvae of the brood parasite
kill the host egg or larva and the brood parasitic larva consumes the pollen-nectar provisions
collected by the host bee. Approximately 13o/o of currently described bee species are brood
parasites (Danforth et al.2019). Nearly all brood parasitic genera have a narrow, well-defined
host range. We indicate in the notes below the presumed host range of each of the brood parasitic
genera. In social parasites, females remain in the nests of their social hosts and become, in effect,
members of the colony. Social parasites are known within the genera Bombus (subgenus
Psithyrus) and Lasioglossum (some species of the subgenus Dialictus; parasitic species were
formerly placed in the subgenus Paralictus).
Interested readers should refer to Michener (2007) for the subgeneric classification of
each genus and relevant keys to subgenera, often organized by geographic region. Keep in mind
that subgeneric classifications are generally less stable than the generic classification we have
used here and that changes may have been made to the subgeneric classification of certain genera
following the publication of Michener (2007). For example, Lasioglossum (Gibbs et al. 2013)
and Hoplitrs (Sediry et al. 2013) have both undergone taxonomic revisions that impact the
subgeneric groupings currently recognized. In such cases, we have indicated this in the entries
below. For genera whose subgenera are often given generic status, such as Lasioglossum, we
give keys to subgenera, or when there are only two such subgenera in our area, we give
di stinguishing characters.
Under "Revision(s)" we list reviews, keys, and so forth, as well as full revisions;
sometimes we give a reference to a relevant work even if it lacks keys to species. To avoid
repetition, the major faunal work (Mitchell 1960, 1962), which includes keys to species as well
as descriptions of the species found east of the Mississippi River (i.e., eastern USA and Canada),
is not cited under each genus; however, that work contains a "revision" of each genus for that
area. For many genera in the eastem USA, Discover Life (https://www.discoverlife.org) has
online keys to species that we highly recommend. However, for some genera (e.g.,
Lasioglossum) these keys may be incomplete, especially for areas west of the Mississippi River
or south of the US-Mexican border. Additional keys for groups which include non-native species
can be found here: https:i'r'idtools.orgi'idibeesiexotic:index.php. Finally, in parentheses, we show
the couplet or couplets to which the genus runs in the keys.
Synonymous names exist for many genera. We list those names that have been in recent
use and that might cause confusion.
Family Andrenidae
Glossa short to long, pointed, with or without flabellum. Labial palpus with segments usually
similar, but some species with elongate mouthparts may have greatly elongated labial and
maxillary palpi (for example, Andrena micheneriana LaBerge, Calliopsis zonalis Cresson), and
Perdita hurdi Timberlake). Mentum membranous or sclerotrzed; lorum scoop shaped, or Y
shaped with arms not as slender as in long tongued bees; mentum and lorum forming a lobe that
projects behind proboscis when proboscis is folded. Usually with paired subantennal sulci but
single in males of some species of Protandrena and sometimes difficult to see in strongly sculptured species. Facial fovea present in Andreninae (females) and Panurginae (females and
many males) but absent in Oxaeinae, conspicuously hairy in Andreninae but appearing smooth in
Panurginae.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. All andrenids are
solitary (or communal), ground-nesting bees. None are brood parasites. Many species are
univoltine with a narrow window of adult activity. Nearly all panurgines, many andrenines, but
probably no oxaeines are oligolectic. All andrenines and oxaeines transport pollen dry but all
panurgines are agglutinators, either initially loading pollen dry onto the hind tibia then adding an
outer layer moistened with nectar (most species) or using nectar to glue all pollen to the sparsely
hairy hind tibia (e.g. many Perdita; see Portman et al. l20l9l for a review of pollen transport in
bees). Vibratile pollen collection is rare in the Andreninae and Panurginae but apparently
universal among the Oxaeinae. The largest genera are Andrena and Perdita. A recent
phylogenetic study by Bossert et al. (2021) provides a stable subfamilial and tribal classification
for this family, which we have followed here.
Andreninae
I . Ancylandrenu Cockerell: Similar to large, hairy, robust, nonmetalli c Andrena; flocculus of
female hind trochanter entirely absent. Medium to large bees (8-15 mm). Rare. Xeric parts of
southern California to New Mexico, Baja California, and Sonora. Most Ancylandrena species are
specialists on legumes (Fabaceae) . A. larreae is a specialist on Larrea (Zygophyllaceae).
Revi sion : Zav ortrnk (1 97 4). (couplets 44 i and 47 6 )
2. Andreno Fabricius: Black or dull metallic blue or green, moderately hairy, andreniform [Figs.
421-4241; females with distinctive velvety facial foveae; sometimes with metasoma red, terga
frequently with hair bands; propodeal scopa often well-developed; flocculus of female hind
trochanter often well-developed; face sometimes with yellow marks, especially clypeus of males.
Mostly medium sized bees but ranging from 6 to 16 mm. Common; over 500 species in our area,
many locally abundant. Many species are oligolectic. Common host-plant families in North
America include Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Cornaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Ericaceae, Fabaceae,
Hydrophyllaceae, Malvaceae, Onagraceae, Portulacaceae, Salicaceae and Solanaceae (Larkin et
al. 2008). Primarily Holarctic plus Africa. In North America common in temperate regions south
to the Mexican plateau and beyond; rare in tropics south to Panama. Keys to the subgenera:
LaBerge (1964,1986), Michener, 2007. Revisions by subgenus (see titles of papers in Literature
cited): Bouseman and LaBerge (1979); Donovan (1977); LaBerge (1967,1969,197la,b,1973,
1977, 1980, 1986, 1987, 1989b); LaBerge and Bouseman (1970); LaBerge and Ribble (1972,

(i969); Thorp and LaBerge, (2005). Dubitzky et al. (2010) provides a phylogenetic analysis of
Andrena based on morphology. A recent phylogenetic study by Pisanty et aL. (2021) indicates
that many of the currently recognized subgenera are paraphyletic, however the keys and
revisions mentioned above are still useful for species identifications (couplets 45 Q, 47 3, and

vThe great majority of species have three submarginal cells (couplets 45 and 47) but two
subgenera (Parandrena and Diandrena) and scattered species in other subgenera have only two
submarginal cells (couplet 193).
3. Megondrena Cockerell: Similar to large nonmetallic Andrena with apical metasomal hair
bands; metasoma sometimes red. Large bees (12-16 mm). Rare; deserts of Nevada, Arizona,
southern Califomia, and probably northwestern Mexico. One species, M. mentzeliae, is a
specialist on Mentzelia (Loasaceae) (Zavorlink 1972) and the other, M. enceliae, is thought to be
a specialist on Larcea (Zygophyllaceae) (Michener 2007). See Zavortink (1972) for additional
notes on the biology. (couplets 45! and 46,$.
Oxaeinae
Oxaeines are large, fast-flying bees. Common features include a greatly reduced stigma,
elongate, slender marginal cell, and strongly protuberant clypeus; males have holoptic eyes that
converge strongly above. Due to their distinctive morphology and biology, oxaeines were
considered a separate family (Oxaeidae) in the past. For a recent generic and subgeneric revision
of Oxaeinae, see Engel (2015). For a revision of North American species see Hurd & Linsley
(1e16).
4. Mesoxsea Hurd and Linsley: Large to very large (13-24 mm), hairy, apiform or euceriform;
head and mesosoma black, terga sometimes feebly metallic, without colored bands. Uncommon.
Ranges from Chiapas, Mexico, to Louisiana, Texas, and southem Arizona, USA, but largely
absent from the Mexican plateau. Distinguished from Protoxaea by the deeply emarginate apex
of S8 (in males) and the conspicuous lateral tufts of long white hair on T5 (female) and T6
(male). Revision: Hurd and Linsley (1976).
5. Oxuea Klug: Large to very large (19-26 mm), hairy, apiform or euceriform, with metasomal
terga or bands on terga bright green. The only other large bees with green bands are some species
of Nomia;the bands in Nomia are not brilliant metallic but rather pearly, and Nomia has a
distinct stigma. Rare. Lowland tropics from southem Brazil to Veracruz, Mexico. Revision:
None, but see Hurd and Linsley (1976). (couplet 94)
6. Protoxuea Cockerell and Porter: Large (14-22 mm), hairy, apiform or euceriform fFigs. 430
and 431] head and mesosoma black, terga weakly metallic, without colored bands, uncommon
but sometimes locally abundant; occurs from Puebla, Morelos, and Guerrero, Mexico, north to
Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, USA. Distinguished from Mesoxaea based on the shape of the
male S8 (entire, not emarginate) and the less developed lateral tufts of hair on T5 (in females)
and T6 (in males), which are rather brown-yellow and not white. Revision: Hurd and Linsley
(1e76).
Panurginae : Calliopsini 7. Calliopsis Smith: Mainly small (4-12 mm) andreniform bees [Figs. 425 and 426], usually
with either yellow integumental tergal bands or hair bands; mesosoma and metasoma dorso-
ventrally flattened, metasoma occasionally red; face usually with yellow or white markings; male
genitalia with greatly enlarged penis valves and with gonostyli absent or essentially so (no other
bees in our area have genitalia of this style). Moderately common, especially in westem USA.
Southem Canada, throughout U.S.A. and Mexico to Central and South America. Widespread in
temperate areas but most common in warm, xeric areas. Nearly all species are oligolectic, most
commonly on Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae or Fabaceae, but also on Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae,
Capparidaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Papaveraceae, Rosaceae, Solanaceae, Verbenaceae or
Zygophyllaceae. Our species previously split into three genera: Calliopsrs (with Calliopsima,
Perissander and Verbenapis); Nomadopsis (with Micronomadopsis); and Hypomacrotero.
Michener 2007 (p.309) provides a key to the subgenera. Revisions: Rozen (1958) for the
subgenera Macronomadopsis Rozen, Micronomadopsis Rozen, and Nomadopsrs Ashmead;
Shinn (1967) for the subgenera Calliopsima Shinn, Calliopsis Smith s.str., Perrs sander
Michener, and Verbenapis Cockerell and Atkins; Danforth (1994) for the subgenus
Hypomacrotera Cockerell and Porter. (couplet 228).
Panurginae: Panurgini
8. Panurginzs Nylander (:Greeleyello Cockerell): Small, slender, black, andreniform, sparsely
hairy, the male almost hylaeiform and often with yellow clypeus. Easily recognized among
North American panurgines by first recurrent vein meeting first transverse cubital. Uncommon in
western North America, rare in east (with just three species east of the Mississippi); southern
Canada, USA, and northern Mexico. Floral host preferences poorly known. Some species are
polylectic but others oligolectic on Limnanthaceae, Malvaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rhamnaceae or
Rosaceae. Recent phylogenetic studies suggest the New World Panurginu.r may be generically
distinct from the Old World species, in which case the genus for the New World species will
become Greeleyella Cockerell. Revisions: Crawford (1926);Michener (1935), one group of
species. (couplet229)
Panurginae: Perditini
A short, truncate marginal cell is characteristic of most Perditini (see couplet 173 and Fig. 306)
and is unique among nonparasitic bees (but note that in some Macrotera, the marginal cell
resembles that of some Protandrena fHeterosarus)). Macrotera and Pseudomacrotera were
previously included in Perdita.
9. Macrotera Smith: Very small to medium, but mainly small (3-10 mm); andreniform; black
with reddish metasoma in most species; non-metallic. Locally common; distributed from North
Dakota, southward and westward through Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and
southern California to Puebla, Mexico. Males in Macrotera show extreme head allometry such
that larger males have massively expanded, quadrate heads. Some species exhibit male
dimorphism: small, flighrcapable males can be collected on flowers, but flightless, large-headedv

vmales are only found within the nest (Danforth 1991). Macrotera was originally treated as part of
Perdita but phylogenetic studies based on morphology (Danforth 1996) suggested that they
constitute a distinct group sister to Perdita sensu stricto. Macrotera (including the subgenera
Cockerellula, Macrotera, Macroteropsis and Macroterella) was elevated to generic level by
Michener (2007). Many species oligolectic on either Malvaceae or Cactaceae. Revision:
Danforth (1996).
10. Perdita Smith: Very small to medium (2-9 mm) but mainly small; andreniform [Figs. 428
and 4291; black to metallic blue or green, commonly with extensive yellow or white markings,
metasoma or whole body sometimes entirely yellow, red, or white Widespread in temperate
region, particularly in plains and deserts, uncommon in humid regions. An enormous group of
over 630 described species. Southem Canada to Costa Rica. Most abundant and diverse in
southwestern US and northern Mexico, absent in Caribbean except one species from Hispaniola
(Ascher and Engel, 2012). Nearly all species are oligolectic, involving many different plant
families including (in rank order of importance) Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Polygonaceae,
Euphorbiaceae, Boraginaceae, Loasaceae, Hydrophyllaceae, Solanaceae , Zygophyllaceae, and
Brassicaceae. Revisions: Timberlake (1954, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1962,1964, 1968, 1971, 1980b);
Griswold and Miller (2010), subgenus Xerophasma; Portman etal. (2016), Heteroperdita;
Portman and Griswold (2017), Procockerellia; Griswold and Parker (1988), Mentzelia group.
(couplets 9l and 174)
The vast majority of species have two submarginal cells and therefore run to 174 in the key; but
some species of subgenus Procockerellia and all species of subgenus Xerophasma have a small
intercalary cell and thus three submarginal cells. They come out at couplet 91.
ll. Pseudomacrotera Timberlake: Small (6-8 mm); andreniform; dark thorax and dark reddish
abdomen similar to the larger members of the genus Macrotera (length 5-7.5mm). Head and
thorax tinged with subtle dark metallic blue or green, unlike those of Macrotera. 56 of the male
is inflated and protruding. Males exhibit enornous variation in head size, as in Macrotera. The
single species (Pseudomacrotera turgiceps (Timberlake)) occurs in the deserts of the
southwestern US (Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah, USA) and Baja California, Mexico.
Specimens have been collected on diverse plant families in southern California. This group was
originally included in Perdita but recent phylogenetic studies (Bossert et al.2021) indicate that
Pseudomacrotero is a distinct lineage. (couplet ##)
Panurginae: Protandrenini
12. Protandrens Cockerell: Small to medium (4-12 mm), andreniform, usually black but
sometimes red, metallic blue or mesosoma or metasoma maculate; males, and sometimes
females, usually with extensive facial maculae. Most with two submarginal cells but three in
Protandrena s. str. Some males in subgenera Heterosarus and Pterosarus lack the usual andrenid
outer subantennal sulcus. Widespread in temperate areas, occurring from southern Canada to
Panama, most abundant and diverse in arid regions of southwestem USA and northern Mexico,
but rare in humid tropics. As currently defined, Protandrena is a strictly North American group. Currently absent from the Caribbean but represented by a Miocene fossil from the Dominican
Republic (Rozen 1996). Many species are oligolectic with all species of Pterosarers and
Pseudopanurgus s. str. oligolectic on Asteraceae, and the lone species of Anthemurgus and
Metapsaenythia oligolectic on Passifloraceae and Lamiaceae, respectively. Some Heterosarus
are oligolectic on Asteraceae Euphorbiaceae, Rhamnaceae or Rubiaceae, but floral hosts are
unkrown for most species. Similarly, some Protandrena s. str. are polylectic while a few are
oligolectic on Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, or Lamiaceae but floral hosts are
unknown for most species. Some of the polylectic species are vibratile pollen collectors.
Previously usually treated either as two genera; with Protandrena for the North American
protandrenines with three submarginals (yius Metapsaenythia) and Pseudopanurgus for the
remaining North American protandrenines with two submarginal cells (Mitchell 1960) or
alternatively as an expanded Protandrena including all the North American protandrenines
except Anthemurgus and Pseudopanurgus s. str. (Michener 2007). Revisions: Michener (1952),
Ruz (1990), Timberlake (1967, 1969, 1973, 1975, 1976).

vFamily Apidae
Glossa long, with flabellum (Michener and Brooks 1984). Labial palpus with first two segments
long, flattened, sheathlike, in striking contrast to last two segments, which are small and directed
laterally (rarely third segment also flattened). Mentum elongate, sclerotized, tapering basally;
lorum Y-shaped or V-shaped, basal arms slender; mentum and lorum forming long lobe
projecting behind proboscis when proboscis is folded. One subantennal suture. Facial foveae
absent or weakly developed. Labrum usually broader than long; if not, narrowed basally to short
articulation with clypeus. Usually three submarginal cells, uncommonly two or even one; if two,
second usually much shorter than first. Scopa, except when absent, on hind tibia; forming a
corbicula in certain tribes. Pygidial plate usually present at least in female.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. Apidae is the largest
family of bees and includes enonnously diverse taxa in terms of morphology, life history, host-
plant associations, and sociality. Like most bee families, Apidae is composed primarily of
solitary, ground-nesting bees but also includes a large proportion of brood parasites (in fact the
largest of any bee family [around 25%]), many cooperatively breeding bees (in the subfamily
Xylocopinae), and many primitively and advanced eusocial groups (including bumble bees
fBombini], stingless bees fMeliponini] and honey bees [Apini]). There are stem and cavity
nesters, wood-nesters, above-ground builders and ground-nesting bees (Danforth et al.2019).
They range from broadly polylectic (e.g., honey bees) to narrow host-plants specialists (e.g.,
members of the tribe Emphorini). A large proportion of the "oil bees" are in this farnily. Higher-
level classification was revised recently by Bossert et al. (2019). Sless et al. (2021) analyzed
phylogenetic relationships among tribes and genera in Nomadinae, Freitas et al. (2020) analyzed
phylogenetic relationships among the tribes and genera of Eucerinae, and Rehan et al. (2012)
analyzedphylogenetic relationship among tribes of Xylocopinae. We follow these studies in our
classification of North and Central American bees (Table 2-1). Taxonomic treatments at the
tribal and subfamily levels include Brooks (1988) for Anthophorini; Snelling (198a) for
Centridini; Snelling and Brooks (1985) for Ericrocidini; Moure and Michener (i955) for
neotropical Eucerini; LaBerge (1957) for Eucerini; Linsley (1939) for Melectini; Roig-Alsina
(1989) for Osirini; Rightmyer (2004) for Epeolini; Linsley and Michener (1939) and Roig-Alsina
(1991) for Nomadinae. Anthophorinae: Anthophorini
See Dubitzky (2007) for an analysis of anthophorine phylogeny and historical biogeography
based on adult morphology.
13. Anthophora Latreille: Small to large, anthophoriform [Figs. 473 and 474], robust, hairy,
with or without tergal hair bands and sometimes with white or yellowish tergal integumental
bands, whole metasoma sometimes covered with pale hair. Often with yellow or pale maculation
on clypeus? scape and/or paraocular area. Most species polylectic but some oligolectic on
Asteraceae; some with modified clypeal hairs with preference for Lamiaceae. Nests excavated in
soil, some with turreted entrances. Common in western USA, rare elsewhere. Boreal, southward
throughout USA, Antilles, and Mexico to Honduras; rare or absent in tropics (cosmopolitan
except Australia). Revision: Brooks ( 1983), subgenus Melea as the bomboides group; Orr et al.
(2018), subgenus Miuanthophora. (couplet 1 l8)
15. Habropoda Smith: Moderate-sizedto rather large, anthophoriform, exactly resembling
Anthophora species in general aspect. Not uncommon in western North America, rare elsewhere.
One species, Habropoda laboriosa, is an important pollinator of blueberries (Vaccinium) inthe
Southeastern United States and can be locally common. Nests excavated in soil. USA from
Rocky Mountain states to Pacific states and Baja California, south in Mexico to Oaxaca; also
Illinois to New England south to Texas and Florida. Revision: None. (couplet 119)
American species of this genus have usually been placed in Emphoropszs Ashmead; Brooks
(1988) has shown that Emphoropsis is a synonym of Habropoda.
Apinae: Apini
16. Apis Linnaeus: Moderate-sized, apiform fFigs. 506 and 507], black, usually with amber or
yellowish areas on metasoma. Apis can be distinguished from all other genera in our area based
on the combination of hairy eyes and absence of hind tibial spurs [Fig. 5a]. Abundant; one
species in our area, the introduced honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. Ubiquitous, tropics north
far into Canada. Formerly rare in lowland moist tropical America, but introduction of the African
subspecies A. mellifera scutellata has resulted in abundan ce of Apis mellifera in both tropical and
temperate regions (now cosmopolitan; originally palearctic, oriental, and African). Highly
eusocial; nests in cavities in trees, in soil, in man-made hives, and so forth; occasionally combs
of cells hang in the open. (couplet 13)Y

America none are all black. Common in mesic temperate and especially cool temperate habitats,
uncommon or rare in deserts and tropics. Arctic, south throughout Canada, USA, Mexico, and on
to South America (holarctic and neotropical). Most species are eusocial, nesting in colonies of
hundreds of workers inhabiting hollows in soil, rodent or bird nests, and so forth. One group
(subgenus Psythirus) are social parasites of free-living Bombus , and a single species of the
subgenus Alpinobombus is parasitic as well (Milliron & Oliver 1966, Brasero et al. 2018).

online ke.v to female bumble bees of the world. (couplet 24)
Apinae: Centridini
Martins & Melo (2016) provided a phylogenetic analysis of Centridini
18. Centris Fabricius: Moderate-sized to large (10-30mm), anthophoriform [Figs. 475 and 4761,
hind legs of both sexes with longer and denser hairs than rn Anthophora; metasoma sometimes
red, sometimes weakly metallic bluish or greenish, and sometimes with yellow tergal bands or
lateral spots. Males in some species are metandric, showing strong allometry with large males
differing greatly in appearance from smaller males of the same species. Common in tropics and
southwestern deserts, elsewhere uncommon or rare. Neotropics north through Mexico and as far
as central Califomia and Kansas; also present in Antilles and Florida. Most species in our area
are oil collectors associated with Krameria and species of Malpighiaceae. Oil-collecting females
have combs of specialized setae on the fore- and mid-basitarsi used to harvest the oils which are
transported in the scopal hairs of the legs. Oils are used to line the brood cells and and in some
cases are mixed with pollen to form the larval provisions but other oil-collectors add only nectar
to the provisions. Most species excavate nests in the soil but some use preexisting holes in wood
or in old Sceliphron nests; others nest in termite nests (subgenus Ptilotopzs). Revisions: Snelling
(1966c,1974,1984); Ayala (1999). Michener (2007) provides a key to subgenera. (couplet 107).
The generic name Hemisia Klug has been used in place of Centris.
19. Epicharis Klug: Large, euceriform or anthophoriform, hairy, similar in appearance to
Centris; metasoma sometimes reddish, sometimes with yellow integumental bands. Uncommon.
Neotropical, ranging through tropical parts of Mexico north to Tamaulipas and Nayarit. All
species excavate nests in the ground. All female Epicharis are floral oil collectors and have tarsal
arrays of modified setae similar to those rn Centris. Pollen preferences poorly known for most
species but some with high proportion of Malpighiaceae pollen in diet. Revision: Snelling
(1984). Michener (2007) provides a key to subgenera . (couplet 106)
Apinae: Euglossini
Euglossine bees are a strictly New World group of solitary (Eulaema and Eufriesea), weakly
social (Euglossa), and brood parasitic (Aglae and Exaerere) species. Males collect volatile compounds, often from orchids, for use in mating. Males have a variety of specializations of the
fore, mid and hindlegs for the collection, manipulation, storage and dispersal of these
compounds. Mouthparts typically greatly elongate. Males can be easily collected using odor
baits but females are much harder to collect. Recent phylogenetic studies include Ramirez et al.
(2010) and Bossert et al. (2019). Roubik & Hanson (2004) provides an illustrated field guide
with keys to the genera and species of Mexico and Central America.
20. Aglae Lepeletier and Serville: Large, metallic blue, more elongate than other Euglossini
lFig. 510]; hind tibia of female slender, straight, without corbicula; scutellum flat, posteriorly
truncate. Brood parasites in nests of Eulaema [see Bossert et al.2019]. Very rare; one species,l.
caerulea Lepeletier and Serville. South America north to Panama. (couplet 21)
2I. Eufriesea Cockerell: Large, anthophoriform [Fig. 51 1], hairy; at least face slightly metallic,
one Mexican species has whole body bright green or blue. Rare or uncommon. Widespread in
American tropics including tropical and subtropical Mexico, north to Chihuahua and San Luis
Potosi. Reported from western Texas and adjacent New Mexico but perhaps only a vagrant
(Griswold et al.2015). Nests of bark and resin in large cavities in trees or rocks. Revision:
Kimsey (1982). (couplet 23)
A well-known synonym is Euplusia Moure.
22. Euglossa Latreille: Moderate-sized to large, anthophoriform [Figs. 512 and 513], brilliant
metallic green or, less commonly, blue, purple, or coppery; proboscis in repose reaching to or
beyond metasoma. Not uncommon. Widespread in American tropics, including tropics of
Mexico to Tamaulipas and Sonora; also Jamaica. One species, Euglossa dilemma,was
introduced to Florida and seems locally common (Pascarella 2017). Resin nests in constructed
large cavities in banks or trees or on leaves or twigs. Revisions: Moure (1969,l97O); Dressler
(1978). (couplet 22)
23. Euloema Lepeletier: Large to very large, bombiform [Fig. 514], nonmetallic or metasoma
weakly metallic, hairy. Uncommon. Widespread in American tropics, north through tropical
Mexico to Tamaulipas and Sonora, one old record for southernmost Texas. Nests in large

Apinae: Meliponini
The tribe Meliponini includes advanced eusocial bees that are most abundant and diverse in the
tropical regions of the world. All members of the tribe Meliponini would be described as"trigoniform". Phylogenetic relationships were most recently analyzed by Rasmussen &
Cameron (2010). Gniter (2020) provides an excellent overview of stingless bee diversity,
behavior, biology, and evolution, as well as an updated generic and subgeneric classification.V

differs from Tetragona in its larger size (8-9mm), large mandibular teeth (two, on the upper part
of the apical margin), and hairy propodeal triangle. Species of this group are remarkable in that
they store large quantities of pollen (up to 3 kg) in association with yeasts and store little honey.

41. Scaura Schwarz: Treated by Michener (2007) as a subgenw of Plebeia. Small, all black
bees (4.0-5.5 mm); differ from other Meliponini in the form of the hind basitarsi, which are
nearly as broad as to broader than the tibia and convex on the outer surfaces, at least apically
(Figure?). These large hind basitarsi are used to glean pollen that falls onto plant surfaces from
the activities of other bees (Laroca and Lauer 1973). Ranges northward to Veracruz, Mexico;

\,Eucerinae: Eucerini
The tribe Eucerini ("long-homed" bees) is a distinctive group. Males have elongate antennae
(Fig. ##) and females have a characteristic w-shaped gradulus on 52 (Figs. 253,254). Once you
become familiar with recognizing these features, it becomes easy to distinguish Eucerini from
other large,hairy, apid bees. The taxonomy of this group has been a challenge, to put it mildly.
The generic and subgeneric boundaries are difficult to define and, while recent phylogenetic
studies have significantly improved our understanding of relationships (Dorchin et al. 2018a,b;
,,Freitas etal.2020) and historical biogeography (Freitas et al. 2022), the morphological features' that allow generic or subgeneric identification remain extremely subtle. For this reason, we have
separated Eucerini out from the main key (see Chapter 9), to facilitate revisions to the key as the
taxonomy changes. Our key (Chapter 9) is based on the key provided in Dorchin et al. (20i8a).
50. Agapanthinus LaBerge: Moderate-sized, euceriform, with pale tergal hair bands; aspect of
Melissodes. Floral hosts unknown but compound eyes and ocelli enlarged suggesting matinal or
crepuscular foraging. Rare; one species, A. callophila (Cockerell). Baja California and
Califomia deserts. See LaBerge (1957). (couplet ## in the Key to Genera of Eucerini)
Eucera Scopoli: Small to large, anthophoriform or euceriform, hairy, fast-flying bees. North
subgenera include Tetralonia (including Tetraloniella), Peponapis, Xenoglossa,
Cemolobus, Syntrichalonia, Synhalonia, and Xenoglossodes (including Pectinapis). This is a
mainly Holarctic group, ranging across our area from Canada to Central America, with few
species in South America, most diverse in temperate areas. Around 400 species worldwide with
approximately 115 species in our area. Many subgroups are narowly oligolectic, including
Cemolobus (oligolectic on lpomoeo), and Peponapis and Xenoglossa (oligolectic on Cucurbita)
This is a challenging group and there is currently no key to the subgenera of North America.

US species, The most common eucerine genus in most of North America. Canada and the
Antilles to Argentina but rare in tropics. Some species nest communally with several individuals
sharing a burrow entrance. Most species in the large subgenus Eumelissodes are oligolectic on
Asteraceae while members of Melissodes s. str. are all polylectic. Other species are oligoletic on
Malvaceae, Pontederiaceae, Onagraceae. Revision: LaBerge (1956a,b; 1961); Svastrawas
included in Melissodes in that revision. A recent phylogeny by Wright et al. (2020) suggests that

58. Protohslonia Dorchin: Originally referred to as the "venusta-group" of Synhalonia,this
genus was recently recognized based on a molecular phylogeny of the Eucera complex (Dorchin

(P. venusta and P. amoena) or entirely dark (P. carinata); pygidial plate strongly elevated along
midline. Rare; primarily distributed in the southwestem USA (including Mojave, Sonoran,
Chihuahuan, and Great Basin deserts) and Baja California, Mexico; P. venusta occurs as far
north as Oregon. The three species of Protohalonia are spring-active and all are reported to be
matinal and vespertine. While species of Protohalonia are considered to be host-plant specialists
on Onagraceae (Clarkia and Camissonia), they are frequently collecte d on Larrea
(Zygophyllaceae) and may be more generalized in their host-plant preferences (Dorchin 2018a).

Eucerinae: Exomalopsini
61. Anthophorula Cockerell: This group was historically includedin Exomalopsis until Silveira
(i993a,b) recognized it as a distinct genus. Anthophorula includes minute to moderate-sized
(2.5-8mm), compact, rotund, hairy, anthophoriform bees with two or three submarginal cells
(hence, this genus comes out in two places in the Key to the Genera); a few species have a red
metasoma. Distributed across the western US as far north as Oregon and eastward to Indiana and
south to Yeracruz and Oaxaca, Mexico. As in Exomalopsis, nests of lnthophorula are usually
communally occupied burrows, each being inhabited by several females (Rozen, 1984). Floral
associations poorly known for most species, some polylectic but others oligolectic on
Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae or Scrophulariaceae. Michener (2001) provides a
key to subgenera. Revisions (as Exomalopsis): Timberlake 1980a).
62. Exomalopsis Spinola: Small to moderate-sized (4-12mm), chubby, hairy, anthophoriform
[Figs. 485 and 486] bees. Common in tropics north to southwestem USA, moist tropics to desert,
uncommon elsewhere. Present from Baja Califomia and Sonora, Mexico; Arizona,New Mexico,
southern Texas and southem Florida, USA; and the Bahamas south through Mesoamerica, the
Antilles and into South America. Nests are communal with multiple females sharing a burrow.
All species appear to be polylectic. (Rozen 1984). Revisions: Timberlake (1947, USA only;
1980a). Michener (2001) provides a key to subgenera. (couplets 127 and 199)
Eucerinae: Tapinotaspidini
Almost all members of the Tapinotaspidini, like most Centridini, are oil-collecting bees. In our
area, females of Monoecahave combs of specialized hair on their fore- and mid-basitarsi while
both males and females of Paratetrapedia have combs only on their fore-basitarsi. Female Monoeca are known to collect oils of Malpighiaceae and most floral oil records for female
Paratetrapedia are for Malpighiaceae as well. Oils are used to line the brood cells and are mixed
with pollen as larval food.
63. Monoeca Lepeletier and Serville: Moderate-sized, anthophoriform, like a large Exomalopsis
without metasomal hair bands; head and thorax hairy; metasoma sometimes red. Rare. Nests
excavated in soil. Tropical America, north in tropical Mexico to Jalisco. Revision: None.

trigoniform [Fig. a87]. Strikingly mimetic of various species of Trigona-black, largely or
wholly yellow or testaceous, black u,ith red metasoma, and so forth; face of male with yellow or
white areas. Moderately common. Widespread in neotropics, extending into tropical Mexico at
least to San Luis Potosi and Jalisco; also Jamaica. Females of the subgenus Xanthopedia nest in
earth banks; females of other subgenera probably nest in preformed holes in wood. Revision:

70. Coelioxoides Cresson: Moderate-sized (7.5-13mm), head and thorax very coarsely pified,
metasoma tapering to point suggestive of Coelioxys, terga with narrow hair bands, wings
darkened with distinct pattern of light and dark areas; extremely long sting. Rare; one species in
our area, C. punctipennis Cresson. Widespread in American tropics, north into tropical Mexico
as far as San Luis Potosi. Brood parasite of Tetrapedia (Alves-dos-Santos et aL.2002). Revision:
Roig-Alsina (1990). (couplet 101)
Nomadinae: Epeolini
Rightmyer (2004) provides a thorough, well-illustrated review and phylogenetic analysis of the
genera of the tribe Epeolini.
71. Epeolus Latreille: Small to moderate-sized, epeoliform, pattemed like Triepeolus.
Moderately common. Southern Canadathrough USA, Antilles, Mesoamerica, and South
Amercia (holarctic, neotropical, and African). Brood parasites of Colletes. Revisions: Onuferko
(2017) for Canada; Onuferko (2018) for the Nearctic region (north of Mexico); and Onuferko
(20T9) for the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico. (couplet 112)
Most species have three submarginal cells and run directly to couplet ll2,but a few have only
two and run to couplet 112 via couplet 181 .
Epeolus has, in the past, been divided into two subgeneru: Epeolus s.s. and Trophocleptria
(sometimes also treated as a genus). A recent phylogentic study by Onuferko et al. (2019)
identified six discrete monophyletic groups within Epeolus but did not designate new subgenera based on these groupings. Before such a subgeneric classification is proposed, we prefer not to
recognize subgenera of Epeolus, as recommended by Onuferko et al. (2019).
72. Odyneropsis Schrottky: Moderate-sized to rather large (9-l7mm), slender epeoliform or
nomadiform, nonhairy, wasplike, largely black or brown. Rare. Widespread in neotropics,
ranging north through Mexico to southern Arizona. Brood parasites of Ptiloglossa. Revision:
None. (couplet 111)
The moderate-sized species, known north only to Panama, have been placed in the genus
Parammobales Friese, but this group does not seem to differ at the generic level from the larger,
typical Odyneropsis.
73. Thulestria Smith: Rather large (12-19mm), epeoliform, brilliantly metallic blue-green
because of colored scalelike hairs; scutellar as well as axillar spines sharp; 56 of female much as
in Triepeohzs; pseudopygidial area of T5 small, dark, about three times as wide as long. Rare;
one species, T. smaragdiza Smith. South America northward to Costa Rica. Brood parasites of
Oxaea. (couplet I 10)
74. Triepeolzs Robertson: Moderate-sized to large, epeoliform [Fig. 493], with striking pattem
of bands and spots produced by areas of short pale pubescence; males almost indistinguishable
from those of Epeolus. Common in nearctic region, rare in tropics. Largest genus of Epeolini in
our area with over 130 species. Southern Canada, USA, Antilles, and Mexico, south to Central
and South America (few species also in palearctic region). Brood parasites of diverse hosts
including Dieunomia (Halictidae), Protoxaea (Andrenidae), Ptiloglossa (Colletidae) but mostly
of Eucerini (Apidae), Revision: Righmyer (2008); provides keys to all female Triepeolus
(excluding the verbesinae and simplex species groups) for western North and Central America.
(couplet 1 12)
The great rnajority of species have three submarginal cells and run directly to couplet 1 12, but a
few have two submarginal cells and run to couplet 712 via couplet 181.
Nomadinae : Epeoloidini
75. Epeoloides Gtaud: Rather small (7-10 mm), dark, nonhairy, epeoliform; body all black.
Extremely rare; only one species, E. pilosullzs (Cresson). Northeastem and central USA and
across southern Canada from Alberta to Nova Scotia (holarctic). Brood parasite of Macropis.
(couplet I 15)
E. pilosulus is one of the rarest bees in North America. It was, in fact, thought to be extinct
because specimens had not been collected since the 1960s. However, a number of reports from
Alberta to Connecticut between2002 and2021have documented that Epeoloides pilosulus is
still present, but remains extremely rare (Sheffield et aL.2004, Sheffield and Heron 2018, Wood
et aL.2019, Wagner & Ascher 2008, Gibbs et al.2021). The biology of the European E.
coecutiens (Fabricius) was described by Bogush (2005). Its presumed host, Macropis, remains
widespread but localized to patches of its required host-plant, Lysimachia (Primulaceae).

without scopa, with somewhat hairy head and thorax and usually with patches or broken bands of
short white hair on metasoma; mostly with three submarginal cells, rarely with two, thus the
genus comes out in two different locations in the Key to Genera. Common in western USA, rare
elsewhere. Frorn Central Alberta to Oaxaca, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and US Virgin

Nomadinae: Neolarrini
See Bossert et al. (2020) for a comprehensive treatment of the phylogeny and classification of
the genera now included in the tribe Neolarrini. These genera were previously placed in three
tribes (Neolarrini, Townsendiellini, and Biastini) which have now been consolidated into a more
broadly defined Neolarrini.
86. Biastes Panzer (North American forms previously treated as genus Neopasites Ashmead):
Minute to small (3.5-8 mm), epeoliform lFig.492), sometimes with red metasoma, and without
discrete patches of short, pale hairs. Rare. Califomia, Anzona, and Baja California Norte. Brood
parasites of Dufourea. Revision: Linsley (1943a), as Gnathopasites. (couplet 201)
87. Neolarra Ashmead: Minute to small (2-7 mm), epeoliform lFig.496l, often largely covered
with short, pale hair; marginal cell very short, truncate, even more reduced than in Perdita.

sometimes red, commonly with bands or areas of short, white pubescence. Rare. Southwestem
USA and Baja California, in xeric areas. Brood parasites of Hesperaprs and probably of
Conanthaliclzs. Revisions: Linsley (1943c), Orr and Griswold (2015). (couplets 179 and202)
Because of variation in the relative lengths of the submarginal cells and in the position of the
first recurrent vein (couplet 175), Townsendiella appears twice in the Key to the Genera.
Nomadinae: Nomadini
90. Nomuda Scopoli: Small (almost minute) to moderate-sized, wasplike, slender nomadiform
fFigs. 498 and 499], without conspicuous pubescence; black or red, commonly with yellow or
white markings, sometimes largely black with metasoma red or largely yellow. Common in
temperate regions, rare in tropics; Nomada is the largest genus of brood parasitic bees in our
area, with nearly 300 total described species (Table 2-1). Boreal regions of Canada throughout
USA, Mexico, Antilles, and on to South America (cosmopolitan, scarce in sub-Saharan Africa
and Australia). Brood parasites of Agapostemon, Andrena, Halictus, Nomia, Exomalopsis,
Synhalonia, and, in the palearctic region, Lasioglossum, Melitta, and Panurgars; most temperate
climate species attack Andrena. Revisions: Evans (1972), subgenus Holonomada; Rodeck
(1949), subgenus Nomadita, underthe name Callinomada Rodeck; Swenk (1912), species of
Nebraska; Broemeling (1988), subgenus Nomadita; Broemeling and Moalif (1988), subgenus
Pachynomada. Snelling's (1986a) subdivision of the genus is not followed here, but the keys to
subgenera provide access to the subgeneric revisions listed above. The largest subgenera have
never been revised. Odanaka et al. (2022) provide a phylogeny and analysis of historical
biogeography. (couplets 33, 178, andl92)
A stable subgeneric classification has not yet been developed (Michener 2001). Because of
variation in the number and relative sizes of the submarginal cells, Nomada comes out three
times in the Key to the Genera; most species run to couplet 33.
Nomadinae: Osirini
Based on the phylogenetic analysis of Sless et al. (2021), the group of genera formerly treated as
the tribe Osirini (sensu lato)has been reclassified into three tribes: Osirini sensu stricto,
Parepeolini, and Epeoloidini. Only Osirini s.s. and Epeoloidini (see above) occur in our area.
97. Osiris Smith: Moderate-sized (6-18 mm), smooth and shiny, nomadiform [Fig. 489],
superficially almost hairless, yellowish brown or rarely blackish. Rare. Widespread in American
tropics, north to San Luis Potosi and Nayarit. Brood parasitic on Paratetrapedia (Michener
2007). Revisions: Shanks (1986; 1987, Mexican species). (couplet 29)
92. Protosiris Roig-Alsina: Moderate sized (9.5-17 mm); superficially like Osiris; see characters
in the Key to the Genera. Rare. American tropics north to Puebla, Mexico. Only one described
species in our area (P. obtusus). Brood parasitic on Monoeca (Tapinotaspidini) in South America (Rocha-Filho & Melo 201l), potentially others. Revisions: Included in Shanks (1986); see
Roig-Alsina (1989). (couplet 29)
Nomadinae: Protepeolini
93. Leiopodzs Smith: Moderate-sized epeoliform [Fig. 491], not hairy but with striking pattem
of areas of short pale pubescence; arolia are extraordinarily large, often longer than the claws,
and swollen apically. Rare. Texas to California south to Guatemala, in xeric regions (other
species, Venezuela to Argentina). Brood parasites of emphorine genera Diadasia, Melitoma, and
Ptilothrix (Rozen et al. 1978, Roig-Alsina and Rozen 1994). Revision: Eickwort and Linsley
(1978). (couplet 125)
In North America this genus has been called Protepeolus Linsley and Michener, which is a
junior synonym of the South American Leiopodus. The tribal name Protepeolini remains valid.
Nomadinae: Rhathymini
94. Nanorhathymus l:RhathyntodeslEngel, Michener, and Rightmyer: Moderate-sized to large
(13-18 mm), elongate epeoliform or nomadiform [Fig. a90]; superficially resemble large
Osirinus (tribe Osirini); mesepisternum lacking large submedian tubercle present in Rhathymus
(see below). Rare; only one species known in our area (Nanorhathymus acutiventris).
Neotropical, ranging northward into central Mexico. Brood parasites but hosts are unknown;
perhaps brood parasites of Epichans. Revision: Engel, Michener, and Rightmyer (2004).
(couplet ###)
95. RhatlrymusLepeletier and Serville: Large (16-28 mm), elongate epeoliforrn or nomadiform
[Fig. a90]; species vary from black, the metasoma frequently red, to largely yellow;
mesepisternum with large submedian tubercle;. Rare. Neotropical, ranging into tropical Mexico
as far as San Luis Potosi. Brood parasites of Epicharis (Michener 2007). Revision: Engel,
Michener, and Rightmyer (2004). (couplet 115)
Xylocopinae: Ceratinini
96. Cerotina Latreille: Minute to moderate-sized, sparsely haired, shiny, slender hylaeiform
[Figs. 503 and 504] or nomadiform but with tibial scopa; black to weakly blue or green or in
tropics varying to brilliant green, some with metasoma coppery or red. Such size and coloration
suggests augochlorine halictids, from which Ceratina differs as follows: -elossa and labial palpi
long, basal vein only gently curved, clypeus shaped like thick inverted T and commonly with a
yellow or white mark in female and extensively pale in male; femoral scopa absent. Common.
Neotropics including Antilles, norlh throughout Mexico and USA (rare in deserts) to Canada
(cosmopolitan). Nests in burrows, usually made by the bees, in pith of dead stems. Polylectic.
Revision: Daly (1973), species north of Mexico; Rehan & Sheffield (201i) for a key and
taxonomic review of the species of Ceratino in the eastern USA (couplets 34 and 120)
Because of variation and especially intermediacy in the apex of the marginal cell (couplet 26),
Ceratina appears twice in the Key to the Genera.:/

97. TetropediaKlug: Rather small, shining, trigoniform, resembling a rather elongate, unusually
hairy (in ours) black Trigona; appearance similar to that of black Paratetrapediabut more hairy,
face of rnale black. Moderately common. Widespread in tropical America, north to Tamaulipas
and Jalisco, absent from Caribbean Islands. Tetrapedia,hke member of the Tapidotaspidini and
Centridini are "oil bees". Both males and females have unusually modified forebasitarsi for oil
collection and modified scopal hairs for transporting floral oils. Unlike other oil-collecting bees,
female Tetrapedia forage from beneath the flower when harvesting oils of Malpighiacae. Oils are
used to line the brood cells and are mixed with pollen as larval food. Apparently polylectic.
Nests in preformed burrows in wood (Alves-dos-Santos et aL.2002, Camillo 2005). Revision:
None. (couplet 103)
Xylocopinae : Xylocopini
98. Xylocops Latreille: Large to very large, anthophoriform or bombiform [Fig. 505], black to
rnetallic blue or green, males of some species with integument and hairs yellow or testaceous.
Wing venation (long, slender marginal cell, second submarginal cell greatly narrowed costad)
distinguishes this genus from all others. Common or moderately common in tropics. Tropical
America, north throughout Antilles, Mexico, and USA to southem Canada (cosmopolitan). Nests
in burrows, usually made by the bees, in wood or stems. All species are polylectic. Spear-like
galeae are commonly used to pierce tubular corollas facilitating nectar robbing. Revisions: Hurd

Family Colletidae
Glossa short, broadly truncate to bifid. Labial palpus with segments similar, none of them
elongate and sheathlike.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. This family is most
abundant and diverse in Australia and South America. In Australia,50o/o of native bee species
are in the family Colletidae (Houston 2018). Colletid diversity in North and Central America is,
by comparison, limited. Two genera (Colletes and Hylaeus) comprise the bulk of colletid
diversity in our area. In addition to Colletinae and Hylaeinae, three additional subfamilies are
represented in North and Central America: Diphaglossinae (three genera), Neopasiphaeinae
(Eulonchopria) and Xeromelissinae (Chilicola).Phylogenetic studies of the family include
Almeida and Danforth (2009) and Almeida et al. (2012, 2019). For a review of nesting biology
see Almeida (2008). Colletids are unique among bees in lining their brood cells with a
"cellophane" coating derived from the Dufour's gland. Females provision their brood cells with a
liquid mix of nectar and pollen that is likely rich in fermentative yeasts (Almeida 2008, Danforth
et al. 2019). Among the colletid bees distributed in the region, there are no social nor brood
parasite species, although several colletids are hosts of Nomadinae (Apidae). Colletinae
99. Colletes Latreille: Rather small to moderate-sized or a few rather large; moderately hairy,
andreniform [Fig. ai7] to apiform, usually with pale tergal hair bands, superficially similar to
Halictus and Andrena but with head in facial view more tapering below, inner orbits of eyes
converging strongly below; glossa short and shallowly bilobed and metasoma more strongly
tapering posteriorly?. Common in our area with over 140 described species; boreal to deserts to
moist tropics (cosmopolitan except Australia). Nests excavated in soil. The majority of species
are polylectic, but many oligolectic on wide range of families including Asteraceae, Solanaceae,
Fabaceae, Ericaceae, Campanulaceae, Sapotaeeae, and Malvaceae. Revision: Stephen (1954),
USA and Canadian species; Balboa et al. (2017 ) revised part of the Mexican and Central
American fauna. (couplet 25)
This is the only genus of bees with the second recurrent vein arcuate distad in its posterior half
[Fig. 79]. See Ferrari et al. (2020) and Ferrari & Packer (2020) for recent phylogenetic studies of
Colletes.
Diphaglossinae: Caupolicanini
100. Caupolicana Spinola: Large or very large; apiform or euceriform [Fig. 418], with bifid
glossa, hairy, sometimes with strong white hair bands on terga. Uncommon in southwestem
USA, otherwise rare. Drier parts of neotropical region; in our area Greater Antilles, Puebla north
to Arizona, Kansas, and North Carolina; absent in moist tropics except for Costa Rica (Hanson et
al.2021). These are large, fast-flying, crepuscular bees. Nests excavated in soil. Floral hosts
poorly known but most seem to be polylectic.We recognize Caupolicana in the broader sense of
Michener (2007), which includes Zikanapis as a subgenus. Revision: Michener (1966). (couplet

metasoma with weak bluish or greenish metallic tints. Uncornmon.Widespread in American
tropics north through Mexico to southern Arizona. Flight mostly at dawn. Nests excavated in
soil. Revision: None (couplet 16)
Diphaglossinae: Dissoglottini (synonym: Mydrosomini)

usually with faint bluish or greenish tint. Rare. Nests unknown. Widespread in Arnerican tropics,
north in Mexico to Sinaloa. Revision: Michener (1986c). (couplets 15 and 124)

104. Hylaezs Fabricius: Minute to small; slender, non-hairy, hylaeiform [Fig. a20]; black or
rarely partly red, usually with limited yellow or white areas on face, thorax, and legs, rarely on
metasoma, sorne with red on metasoma; aspect that of small black wasp; glossa broadly truncate;
scopa of female entirely absent (pollen transported in crop). Common in temperate areas,
uncommon to rare in tropics. Boreal Canada to Panama and Antilles (cosmopolitan). Nests in
hollow twigs or stems, occasionally in preformed burrows in banks. All North American species
appear to be polylectic. Some Hawaiian species inferred to be brood parasites as they lack the
usual pollen collecting hairs on their fore-tarsi. (Daly & Magnacca2003). Revisions: Snelling
(1966b, 1968,1970), Daly (1973); none of these papers covers Mesoamerican species
adequately; Hawaiian species were revised by Daly & Magnacca (2003). (couplet 177)
The subfamily Hylaeinae, and the genus Hylaeus, are most diverse in Australia, their likely
place of origin (Almeida et al.2012; Kayaalp et aL.2013). Hylaeus is estimated to have dispersed
from Australia approximately 22 mrllion years ago (Kayaalp et al. 2013) and is now one of the
few cosmopolitan bee genera.
Neopasiphaeinae (formerly referred to as'oParacolletinae")
105. Eulonchopria Brdthes: Small to moderate-sized; coarsely sculptured, sparsely hairy,
robust andreniform or apiform, with yellow integumental tergal bands; forewings often folded
longitudinally like those of vespid wasps (Danforth and Michener 1988). Uncommon. Xeric
neotropical regions, South America, Nicaragua to western Mexico (Oaxaca to Nayarit), north to
southern Arizona. Nests unknown but presumbly excavated in soil. Usually associated with
rnimosoid legumes. Revisions: Michener (1963,1985b). (couplet 123)
Xeromelissinae (synonym: Chilicolinae)

marks except on clypeus of some males; glossa broadly truncate; scopa limited, sparse on hind
femora and perhaps tibiae, better developed on S1-S3 (especially S2). Uncommon in our area.
Neotropical, in xeric or montane regions, north to states of Hidalgo and Jalisco, also Lesser
Antilles. Nests in stems and holes in wood. Revisions: Michener (199$; Toro and Michener
(1975). See Packer (2008) and Almeida et al. (2008) for phylogenetic analyses of
Xeromelissinae. Packer (2008) provides a revised subgeneric classification and a key to the
subgenera of Chilicola. (couplet 177)
Family Halictidae
Glossa short to rather long, pointed, without flabellum. Labial palpus with segments similar,
none of thern elongate and sheathlike or first sometimes elongate. Mentum membranous; lorum
weakly sclerotized or sclerotized only laterally; mentum and lorum not forming lobe projecting
behind proboscis (Michener 1985a). Lacinia a small lobe on base of proboscis, well separated from rest of maxilla (Michener and Greenberg 1985). One subantennal suture. Facial fovea
absent, See Moure and Hurd (1987) for a catalog of species of the Western Hemisphere.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. The family Halictidae
includes a diverse array of solitary, communal, semisocial, primitively eusocial, brood parasitic
and socially parasitic species. The largest genus, Lasioglossum,includes over 400 species in
North America and is a model for understanding the evolution of social behavior in bees (Gibbs
et aL.2012). Molecular phylogenetic studies have provided a powerful tool for understanding
phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies, tribes, and genera in this difficult group (Danforth
et al.2004,2008, Patiny et al. 2008, Gibbs et al.2012).
Halictinae: Augochlorini
The tribe Augochlorini was originally revised by Eickwort (1969) and, later, Engel (2000). The
phylogeny of Augochlorini was analyzed most recently by Gongalves (2016) based on molecular
and morphological data. We follow the Gongalves (2016) generic classification below.
107. Andinaugochlora Eickwort: Moderate-sized (8-10 mm long); andreniform; bright metallic
green or red, rather hairy bees, often with brassy or blue reflections or a metallic red metasoma.
They are similar to Neocotynura-and may prove to be derived from it-but differ in the lack of
any pronotal or anterior scutal modifications and in the nonpetiolate metasoma of males. The
paraocular lobe is less obtuse than Neocotynura. Revision: A single species (A. centralpina),
reported from Costa Rica and known only from the male, occurs in our area (Engel and Smith-
Pardo 2004). (couplets ## [a] and## [i] in the Key to Genera of Halictinae)
108. Aagochloro Smith: Small to moderate-sized; andreniform; bright green or blue, in some
tropical species with brassy or red, or almost entirely purple or black. Common; many
neotropical species. Tropical America north through the Antilles and tropical Mexico to eastem
and central USA and southem Canada; less common in desertic areas and western USA. This is
the largest genus of Augochlorini in our area. The subgenus Augochlora Smith s.s/r. consists of
solitary and primitively eusocial bees that nest in rotting wood. The subgenus Oxystoglossella
Eickwort consists of ground-nesting, primitively eusocial species. Lepeco & Gonzalez (2022)
provide a phylogenetic analysis of the species with an examination of nesting and sociality.

709. Augochlorello Sandhouse: Small; andreniform; bright metallic green, bluish, or brassy;
often smaller than Augochlora but larger than Pereirapis. Uncommon in deserts but common
elsewhere. Widespread in neotropics; uncommon in Central America, north through Mexico,
USA, southern Canada, absent from Antilles. Eusocial in small colonies. Revision: Ordway

throughout eastern and central USA to southern Canada, west to Arizona, absent from Antilles.
Most species are believed to be solitary but Coelho (2002) reported that Augochloropsis zrzs is
primitively eusocial and Gibbs (2017) reported evidence for division of labor in an A. metallica

Caenohalictus, from which it differs in tribal characters (couplet 54). Uncommon. Tropical
America, north into Mexico as far as San Luis Potosi and Sinaloa. Revision: Subgenus
Ctenoaugochlora treated by Engel (1996). (couplets ## t?l and## [i] in the Key to Genera of

ll3. Megalopra Smith: Moderate-sized to rather large; andreniform [Fig. a33]; usually more or
less testaceous with bright metallic green reflections. Perhaps not uncommon but nocturnal and
rarely collected. Tropical America, north through Mexican tropics at least to Nayarit. Excavates
nests in rotting wood and vines. A single brood parasitic species, M. (Noctoraptor) byroni Engel,
Brooks and Yanega(1997) is known from Panama (Biani and Wcislo 2007). Revision: None.

parts of mesosoma yellow-orange or with metallic reflections. Pronotum dorsolateral angle
carinate and strongly produced but without carina below angle. Inner metatibial spur ciliate. Part
of the Neocorynura grouip, most closely related to the South American Paroxystoglossa Moure.
Only one species (M. byronel/a) occurs in our area (Panama). Revision: Engel and Brooks

l15. MegaloptinaEickwort: Small; andreniform; superficially like Augochlora or
Augochlorella. Megaloptina shares an elongate, slender proboscis (see Michener 2007, Fig. 67-
4b) that fits into an unusually narrow proboscidial fossa with several other, mostly South
American genera (Megaloptidia grotp). Treated as a subgenus of Megommation Moure by
Michener but applied at the generic level by Moure (2007) and Gongalves (201 6). Two
subgenera (Cleptommation and Megaloptina s.s.) occur, each with a single species in our area
(from Costa Rica and Panama). Megaloptina is a pollen-collecting bee whereas Cleptommation
lacks a scopa and is presumed to be a brood parasite (Michener 2007). Cleptommationhasbeen
considered a distinct genus (Engel 2013), but it likely renders Megaloptina paraphyletic
(Gongalves 2016). Revision: for Cleptommation (Engel 2013). (couplets ## t?l and## [,3] in the

metasoma attenuate basally (petiolate) lFig. a3q as in Habralictus, which consists of much
smaller species; bright green to largely black, often with wings darkened. Sometimes common.
Widespread in tropical America north to Lesser Antilles and through tropical Mexico to San Luis
Potosi. Species in our area belonging to the subgenus Neocorynura s.str. Certain species (in
South America) nest in wood, but others nest in soil. Revision: None. (couplets ## t?] and##

metasoma. Common; there is disagreement if Pereirapis is a single variable species or as many
as eight (Michener 2007; Moure 2007). Tropical America northward through tropical Mexico to
Jalisco; records from Hispaniola. Michener (2007) treats Pereirapis as a subgenus of
Augochlorellabut recent phylogenetic studies (Gongalves 2016) indicate that it is a distinct
genus. Revision: None. (couplets ## lQj and## [J] in the Key to Genera of Halictinae)

America, north to Lesser Antilles and through tropical Mexico to Sinaloa and southernmost
Texas. Revision: None. (couplets ## lal and ## [d,] in the Key to Genera of Halictinae)
The name Pseudaugochloropsis Michener has also been applied to this group.
l19. Temnosomo Smith: Small to moderate-sized; andreniform; brilliant green to blue, coarsely
punctate [Fig. a36]; bases of metasomal terga depressed (constricted as seen in profile). Rare

Halictinae: Halictini
Phylogeny of the tribe Halictini was most recently analyzed by Gibbs et al. (2012).
127. Halictus Latreille: Small to rather large; andreniform [Figs. 439 and 440]; weakly metallic
greenish or not metallic. Differs from Lasioglossum females and some males in strong distal
venation of forewing (couplet 55); unlike Lasioglossum,both sexes have strong apical pale tergal
hair bands. Common. Canada through whole USA and Mexico to Central America and Antilles,
continuing into South America (holarctic and African). Most nests are primitively eusocial, with
some reversions to solitary nesting. Revisions: Sandhouse 09aD; Wille and Michener (1971),126. RhinetulaFrrese: Moderate size; andreniform [Fig. aa3]; scarcely metallic, with hairy
eyes; relatedto Parogapostemon. Propodeum wholly declivous. Rare; one species in our area, R.
denticrus Friese. Occurs as far north as Honduras in lowland forests; crepuscular. See Roberts

128. Lasioglossum Curtis: Minute to moderate-sized; andreniform [Figs. 441 and 442f,males
often slender; black or dull green or blue, in Antilles rarely bright green; metasoma sometimes
yellow to red but usually brown or occasionally dull metallic. Weakened distal veins of forewing
(Fig. ##) characteristic only of this genus. Weakening of veins often not or scarcely perceptible
in males. Basal tergal bands or basal lateral patches of pale hair (tomentum) commonly present
and pale hair may spread over much of tergal surface; apical bands, such as occur in Halictus,
are not found in American Lasioglossum. Abrtndant, the most common genus of bees in most
north temperate localities; there are nearly 400 species in our area. Boreal to tropical
(cosmopolitan). The great majority of species have three submarginal cells but a few species (in
subgenera Dialictus, Habralictellus and Hemihalictrzs) have two submarginal cells. (couplets ##
IQ] and ## l,l in the Key to Genera of Halictinae)
The subgeneric classification of Lasioglossum has been extraordinarily difficult to resolve and
highly unstable. Gibbs (Gibbs 201 8 and Gibbs et al. 2013) recently developed a classification
based on a robust phylogeny for the genus that recognizes 8 subgenera in North America:
Lasioglossum s.str., Leucalictus, Dialictus, Eickwortia, Evylaeus, Hemihalictus, Sphecodogastra,
and Habralictellus. The latter is likely a deriviativ e of Hemihalictus s. /. Socially parasitic species
previously placed in Paralictus are polyphletic and now included within Dialictus.ln general,
the subgenera Dialictus, Erylaeus, and Sphecodogastra include many primitively eusocial
species whereas the other subgenera include mostly solitary species. Females in the vast majority
of Lasioglosszrz species nest in the soil but a few species of Dialictus have switched to nesting
in soft, pulpy, rotting wood (e.g., Lasioglossum lDialictusl coeruleum). For keys to the species
within our area, see: McGinley (1986) for Lasioglossutn sensu stricto; Gibbs (2010 and201l) for
Dialictus in Canada and eastern North America; Gardner and Gibbs (2020) for Dialictus in
westem North America with pale metasoma; Gibbs et aL.2013 for Evylaeus, Hemihalictus, and
Sphecodogastra (s.1.) in eastern North America; McGinley (2003) for nocturnal, crepuscular and
matinal Sphecodogasrra (s.str.). Caribbean species have been treated by island in several papers
by Gibbs, Genaro or Engel.

Halictinae: Sphecodini
All members of the tribe Sphecodini are brood or social parasites of solitary, communal, and
primitively social bees (Danforth et al. 2019). Gongalves (2021) provides a revised generic
classification of the tribe Sphecodini with a key to genera recognized in his classification. Our
classification differs, as noted below.
130. Microsphecodes Eickwort and Stage: Similar to minute Sphecodes in appearance but often
paler in color; sculpturing often weaker than usual in Sphecodes; free part of marginal cell three
times as long as part subtended by submarginal cells. Rare. Widespread in neotropical region, as
far north as Guatemala (Packer et al. in press?). Brood parasites or social parasites in nests of
other small Halictini, namely Lasioglossum (Dialictus) and Habralictus. A phylogeny by
Habermannov6 et al. (2013) suggests that Microsphecodes arose from within Austrosphecodes, a
Neotropical lineage of Sphecodes s./. Due to its current usage and distinctive form, we recognize
Microsphecodes here at the generic level until a more robust classification is available. Revision:
None. (couplets ## L?l and## [c'] in the Key to Genera of Halictinae)
13l. Nesosphecodes Engel. Small to moderate-sized; andreniform; similar to Microsphecodes
but are generally larger, without yellow markings, and free part of marginal cell two times as
long as part subtended by submarginal cells. Rare. Three described species from the Greater
Antilles.. Revision: Engel (2006).
132- Ptilocleptis Michener: Small, andreniform; body black and extensively covered with pale
plumose hair; surface is less coarsely sculptured than usual in Sphecodes. Very rare; only one
described species in our arca (Ptilocleptis tomentosa). Widespread in neotropics, north to Nuevo
Leon. Brood parasitic. Host-associations are poorly known but potentially attack Augochlorini
(Michener 2007). Revision: Michener (1978). (couplets ## t?] and## [d'] in the Key to Genera

133. SphecodesLatreille: Minute to moderate-sized; andreniform lFig.4aal; black with
metasoma partly or wholly red in females and many males; sparsely haired, terga shiny, without
hair bands; punctation of most species very coarse, as is pitting at base of propodeum. Extremely
broad head (couplet 52) is distinctive. Common in temperate regions, uncommon in tropics.
Boreal to tropical, Canada to Panama and Antilles (cosmopolitan). Sphecodes s./. is rendered
paraphyleticby Microsphecodes and Eupetersza (Habermannovd et al. 2013) and likely other
taxa in the tribe. Austt'osphecodes and Melissocleptis Gongalves (new slmonymy) are included
within ot;rr Sphecodes s.l. Some characters used to define Melissoclepris, like the short scape, also
occur in temperate species of Sphecodes. Brood parasites in nests of other Halictinae, Iess

vNomiinae
The subfarnily Nomiinae includes solitary or communal, ground-nesting bees. They are most
diverse in the Old-World tropics with many genera in tropical Africa and Asia (Michener 2007)
In our area, we have only two genera'. Dieunomia (tribe Dieunomiini) and Nomia (tribe
Nomiini). Bossert et al. (2021) published a phylogeny of Nomiinae which supports the two
tribes.
134. Dieunomia Cockerell: Moderate-sized to large; andreniform; usually with apical tergal hair
bands, without colored integumental bands; metasoma sometimes partly or wholly red. Common
in central and southwestern USA, elseu,here uncommon. Nests excavated in soil, all oligolectic
on Asteraceae. Southem Canada, USA except northeast, south to Jalisco. Revision: Blair (1935)
for Dieunomia s.str., Cross (1958) for subgenus Epinomia. (couplet 36)
135. Nomia Latreille: Moderate-sizedto large; apiform or andreniform [Figs. 445 and446];
somewhat hairy; terga without hair bands, with apical, hairless, blue, green, or yellowish
integumental bands. Nests excavated in soil, all polylectic. Nomia melanderi is managed for
alfalfa pollination. Common, western USA, elsewhere in our area uncommon. USA south to
Veracruz and Guerrero, not or scarcely in tropics; Antilles (cosmopolitan except South America)
Revision: Ribble (1965). (couplet 36)
Nomia and Dieunomia can be run through either couplets 35 or 121 in the Key to the Genera
because it is difficult to decide on the proper course at couplet 26.
Rophitinae
Members of the subfamily Rophitinae are distinct from other halictid bees in the placement of
the antennae low on the face (Michener 2007). They are all ground-nesting, solitary or
communal bees. Most species are naffow host-plant specialists on a variety of plant families (see
below). We follow the tribal classification of Patiny et al. (2008) below.
Rophitinae : Con anthalictini
736. Conanthalictus Cockerell: Small to minute; andreniform; blackish or greenish, with dull,
minutely roughened, scarcely punctate integument. Rather uncommon. Texas, Utah to Califomia

tergal hair bands. Not uncommon in western and central USA, elsewhere rare. Canada, USA,
Mexican desert and plateau south to Oaxaca (holarctic). North American species of Dufourea are
oligolectic on a wide variety of plant families including Asteraceae, Boraginaceae,
Campanulaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Hydrophyllaceae, Lamiaceae, Liliaceae, Malvaceae, Phrymaceae, Polemoniaceae, Pontederiaceae, and Rosaceae. Revision: Canadian species,

Rare. Southeastern Kansas, Oklahoma, and westem Texas to southern California, U.S,A., and
south to the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Females are oligolectic on Nama (Hydrophyllaceae).
Revision: Timberlake (1961), as subgenus of Conanthalictus. (couplet 40)
141. Xeraliclzs Cockerell: Large (11-12.5 mm); andreniform; blackish or partly reddish. Rare.
Deserts of California, Nevada, and Baja Califomia. Females are oligolectic on Mentzelia and
Eucnide (Loasaceae). Revision: Snelling and Stage (1995b). (couplet 37)
Family Megachilidae
Proboscis as in Apidae. One subantennal suture. Facial fovea absent. Labrum longer than broad
and widened to broad articulation with clypeus. Two submarginal cells in forewing, usually
about equal in length. Pygidial plate usually absent.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. Megachilidae
includes both solitary and brood parasitic groups. Among the solitary species there is an
extraordinary diversity of nesting habits, including wood-nesters, stem and cavity nesters that use
leaves, flower petals, plant fibers, and resins to build their nests, and even above-ground builders
that use resins, sand, and stones (Danforth et a|.2019 provides an overview of the varied nesting
habits in this family). Floral preferences range from broadly polylectic species to narrow host-
plant specialists. The phylogeny and classification of Megachilidae has undergone significant
revisions due to analyses of morphological and molecular data. Higher level classification was
revised by Litman et al. (201 1) and Gonzalez el al. (2012). Generic relationships in Osmiini were
teanalyzedby Praz et al. (2008), in Anthidiini by Litman et al. (2016), and in Megachilini by
Trunz et al. (2016) . We follow these studies in our classification of North and Central American
bees (Table 2-1). v

145. AnthidiumFabricius: Moderate-sized to large, broad-bodied, rather squarish
megachiliform [Fig. 454], with yellow markings, usually extensive. The multiple, close-set
mandibular teeth of the female distinguish this genus from all others in our area except the
adventive Pseudoanthidium. Widely distributed from Canada, Alaska, southward through
western and central USA (adventive A. manicatum and A. oblongatunt extend the range to the
east coast) and Mesoamerica; also present in South America (cosmopolitan except Australia).
Nest cells of plant hairs in small cavities in wood, in sterns, in or between stones, in soil or rarely
excavated in soil. All native species are in Anthidium s.str. Revisions: Grigarick and Stange

the hind tibia of the female is a unique feature of this genus. Rare. This mostly South American
group ranges northward to central Mexico (San Luis Postosi). Austt"ostelis was originally treated
as a subgenus of Hoplosfe/rs (Michener & Griswold 1994) but has since been elevated to generic
status by Michener (2007). Like other brood parasitic anthidiines (Hoplostelis, Rhynostehs, and
Stelis), female Austrostelis lack a scopa. Hosts are largely unknown, except for one confirmed
record of Austrostelis catamarcensis emerging from nests of Epanthidium tigrinum (Zanella &

Dianthidiurn comes out twice in the key because of differences among subgenera in the presence
or absence of the arolium. The subgenera are separated by the following key, modified from that
of Griswold and Michener (1988):

metasoma tapering to blunt apex, often red, terga with narrow apical bands of pale hair (except
one species covered with golden hair), prominent metanotal process. Rare. Western half of USA,

Megachilinae: Megachilini
161. Coelioxys Latreille: Moderate-sized, megachiliform lFig. 4621, with metasoma tapering
apically, in female to sharp point, in male to several teeth; metasomal terga rarely red, usually
with transverse basal grooves and narrow white hair bands. Not uncommon. Boreal to tropical
regions (cosmopolitan). Brood parasites primarily of Megachile,but some on Centris and
Euglossa; in other continents reported also on Anthophora. See Rocha Filho & Packer (2017) for
phylogenetic analysis, subgeneric classification, and key to the subgenera. Revisions: Baker
(1975), most subgenera, USA and Canada; see also Mitchell (1913). (couplet 182)
162. MegachileLatreille: Small to large megachiliform [Figs. 463 and 464] or sometimes
heriadiform [Fig. 465], usually with pale tergal hair bands. Common, with over 200 described
species in our area. Canada through USA, Mesoamerica, Antilles and throughout South America;
present in all climatic zones (cosmopolitan). Megachile is an enorrnously diverse group in terms
of nesting biology and host-plant associations. The genus can be divided into "leaf-cutters" that
use leaf discs to line their brood cells in pre-existing cavities or the ground, and "daubers" that
build their brood cells with resin or mud mixed with salivary secretions in pre-existing cavities,
holes in the ground, or sometimes exposed on the surface of stones or wood (Trunz et al.2016).
Phylogenetic studies based on molecular (Trunz et al.2016) and morphological (Gonzalez et al.
2019) data indicated that leaf-cutters have arisen from a basal grade ofdaubers. Species of
Megachile range from generalists to specialists, with host-plant specialists often associated with
Asteraceae, Onagraceae, Fabaceae, and Cactaceae. Some recent studies have proposed dividing
the genus Megachile into over 20 genera, many of which are difficult to diagnose
morphologically. We retain the the broader definition of Megachile, following Michener (2007)
and Trunz et al. (2016). Revisions: Mitchell (1934-37), species north of Mexico; Mitchell (1956)
and Snelling (1990) for subgenus Chelostomoides; Gonzalez and Griswold (2007) for
Argyropile; Bzdyk (2012) for Litomegachile; for Mesoamerica, none except for Chelostomoides,
Argtropile, and Litomegachile, but see Mitchell (1930, 1943). Michener (2007) provides keys to the subgenera of Megachile in the Western Hemisphere. Sheffield et al. (2011) provide a key to
and thorough taxonomic treatment of the 38 species present in Canada and Alaska. (couplet 221)

black or with a red metasoma, tergal bands of pale hairs present; anterior surface of first
metasomal tergum concave, delimited by carina almost as in Heriades. Males readily recognized
by four teeth on T6 except subgenus Isosmia. Common in southwestem USA, especially Mojave
and adjoining deserts (Murray et al.202l), elsewhere uncommon or rare. Western North
America from southern Canada to Oaxaca and Quintana Roo. Nests in pre-formed burrows in
stems or probably in other small spaces, also in snail shells. Murray et al. (2021) provide a
molecular phylogeny, analysis of phenology and host-plant associations, and a revised
subgeneric classification for the genus. Revision: Michener (1939a); Hurd and Michener (1955)
for California but covers most species. (couplet 226)
164. Atoposmia Cockerell: Minute (5mm) to moderately sized (i0mm) megachiliform; often
black (subgenera Atoposmia and Eremosmia) but sometimes weakly metallic green (subgenus
Hexosmia). Distributed in western North America from British Columbia, eastward to Montana,
Colorado and Wyoming, southward through Arizona, Texas, Baja California to central Mexico
(Puebla and Morelos) (nearctic). Uncommon in the montane areas, rare elsewhere. Members of
the subgenus Atoposmia are specialists on Penstenton and Keckiella (Plantaginaceae). Nests are
built above or belorv ground from masticated plant material, soil or a mixture of the two
(Michener 2001). Revisions: Michener Q9a3); Hurd and Michener (i955) for westem
Atoposmia and Hexosmia, and California Eremosmia. In the first edition of this book, Atoposmia
was treated as a subgenw of Hoplftrs. Michener (2007) elevated Atoposmia to generic level; a
result that was confirmed by Sedivy et al. (2013) based on a molecular phylogeny of Hoplitis and
relatives.
165. Chelostoms Latreille: Minute to smallish, unusually slender heriadiform [Fig. 468], with or
without very weak tergal hair bands; apex of metasoma of male only slightly curled under, six
exposed stema; sculpturing fine, no series of pits across base of propodeum. Not uncommon in
Pacific coast states, rare in central and eastern states. Southern Canada to Baja California, east to
Atlantic coast; two additional introduced species (Chelostoma campanularum and C. rapunculi)
in the eastern US (holarctic). Nests in preformed burrows in wood.
All western species belong in subgenus Neochelostoma.The single native eastern and
central North American species, C. philadelpfri (Robertson), has long been put in a separate
genus, Prochelostorea Robertson (see Michener 1938c), but is nested within monophyletic
Chelostoma (Praz et al 2008). Chelostoma philadelphi is oligolectic on Philadelphus
(Saxifragaceae). Because of difficulty of decision at couplet 183, Chelostoma comes out at two
places in the Key to the Genera. Revisions: Michener (1938a,c); Hurd and Michener (1955).

spring in much of western USA; uncommon elsewhere. Boreal (northem Canada and Alaska)
throughout USA south to Puebla in Mexico (holarctic and African). Females nest in pre-existing
cavities in wood or stone cracks, or excavated burrows in the ground or pithy stems. Some
species build exposed nests constructed of pebbles and mud. Sedivy et al. (2012) provides a
robust molecular phylogeny for the genus Hoplitis, a revised classification of the subgenera, and
a thorough review of diversity in nesting biology. Based on their classification, the valid New

metallic (sometimes brilliantly so like chrysidids or Augochlora), rarely black in boreal and
montane environments, usually without appreciable tergal hair bands. Common in western North
America (rare in deserts), moderately common in east, uncommon in Mexico. This is the largest
osmiine genus in our area with over 148 species. Alaska, Canadian northern territories, south
through most of Canada, entire USA and mountains of Mexico to Costa Rica; some desert
species in northwestern Mexico and southwestern USA; absent in tropics (holarctic). Females
exhibit diverse nesting habitats. Nests can be constructed in pre-existing cavities, old nests
created by other bees and wasps, abandoned snail shells, and crevices in stone. Some species dig
nests de novo in sand, soil or even dung pats; others construct exposed nests. Females construct
brood cells using a pulp of finely masticated leaf tissue, mud. or a combination of leaf masticate
and soil. Several species are managed as pollinators of fruit crops. Reviews of nesting biology in

The American species, formerly put in its own genus, Chelostomopszs Cockerell, is now
considered as a subgenus of the otherwise palearctic Protosmia. This relationship was suggested
by Popov (1961), and the classificatory change was made by Griswold (1986b).

apical bands of white hair on metasomal terga; anterior surface of T1 convex except for
Iongitudinal depression, not margined by carina; apical margins of terga concave. Rare; one

Family Melittidae
Glossa short, pointed, without flabellum. Labial palpus with segments similar, none of them
elongate and sheathlike. Mentum elongate, sclerotized, tapering basally; lorum Y-shaped, basal
arms slender as in long-tongued bees; mentum and lorum forming long lobe projecting behind
proboscis when proboscis is folded. One subantennal suture. Facial fovea absent.
NOTES ON THE BIOLOGY, PHYLOGENY, AND CLASSIFICATION. Melittid bees are all
ground-nesting, solitary, and with narrow host-plant preferences. They are most diverse in
Africa, where all three subfamilies occur. This family is absent frorn South America and
Australia. Phylogeny of Melittidae was most recently analyzed by Michez et a7. (2009) and we
follow the classification used therein.
Dasypodainae -- Hesperapini
17l. Hesperapis Cockerell: Small to moderate-sized, andreniform, usually with tergal hair
bands; metasoma, especially of female, dorso-ventrally flattened and integument soft, rarely red.
Differs from superficially similar and more common genera, such as Andrena, Halictus,
Lasioglossum, and Colletes by the presence of the tibial (rather than trochanteral/femoral) scopa.
Not uncommon. Western and central USA, north to North Dakota (but absent from northeastem
and northwestern states), east to Florida, south to Baja California, Morelos and Puebla. Nests
with unlined cells excavated in sandy soils. The majority of species are host-plant specialists on
Asteraceae, Malvaceae, Fabaceae, Onagraceae, Boraginaceae andZygophyllaceae (Stage 1966).

metasoma and limited pale hair bands. Uncommon. Eastern and central USA and southem
Canada, west to British Colombia and Washington state (holarctic). Macropis are highly
specialized "oil bees" that collect floral oils from plants in the genus Lysimachia (Primulaceae).
Females have densely-packed, sponge-like brushes on the fore- and mid-tarsi for sponging up
floral oils. The oils are used to line the brood cell and are mixed into the pollen provisions as
food for developing larvae (Cane et al. 1983). Excavate shallow nests in moist soils. Oligolectic
on Lysimachia. Our species are in the subgenus Macropls s.str. Revision: Michez & Patiny

Melittinae - Melittini
173. Melilta Kirby: Moderate-sized, andreniform [Fig. 450], with tergal hair bands. Appearance
like that of moderate-sized, nonmetallic Andrena; females differing by lack of trochanteral and
femoral scopa and absence of facial foveae. Rare. Quebec, Canada, eastem USA and deserts of
Arizona, California, and Baja Califomia (holarctic and African). Dellicourt et al. (2014) provide
a phylogeny of the genus and an analysis of historical biogeography and host-plant evolution.
Melitta eich,ttorti, M. melittoides, and M. americana are specialists on Ericaceae. The host plant
