The nests of bees are the places where their young are
reared. They are always to some degree made by the
mother, or, in social bees, by the workers. Nests and es-
pecially cells, their provisions, and larval behavior are full
of meaningful details of importance not only for bee sur-
vival but also for our understanding of adaptations and of",NA,NA,NA,NA

important and detailed early studies of these matters, cul-
minating in his summary work (Malyshev, 1935). Some
of the best and most critical recent accounts are in Rozen’s
papers. References to many papers that include informa-
tion on nest architecture are in the accounts of taxa in later
parts of this book. General accounts were by Michener",NA,NA,NA,NA

gives rise to lateral burrows, each of which ends in a sin-
