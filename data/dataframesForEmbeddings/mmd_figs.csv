Fig. 2 focuses on the detailed anatomy of the insect head capsule, specifically highlighting the malar area and facial foveae. The malar area, a critical anatomical feature, is depicted as the space between the eye and the mandible. This figure illustrates the malar area with clear demarcations, emphasizing its significance in measuring the shortest distance from the lower edge of the eye to the base of the mandible. Additionally, the figure includes representations of the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are shown as shallow depressions, typically black in color, providing insights into their textural and color variations which are vital for species identification and anatomical studies. The labeling in the figure is precise, aiding in the understanding of the spatial relationships and morphological characteristics of these key components within the head capsule of the insect. This detailed visualization serves as an essential resource for entomologists and researchers studying insect morphology and taxonomy."

Fig. 3 provides a detailed illustration of the anatomical features of a bee's head, focusing specifically on the genal area and the preoccipital ridge. The genal area, depicted as the region behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge, is crucial for understanding the lateral boundaries of the head capsule. The preoccipital ridge, prominently featured in this figure, forms a distinct boundary surrounding the concave posterior surface of the head, both above and laterally. This ridge is marked by the presence of the preoccipital carina, a ridge-like structure that adds to the structural complexity of the head. Additionally, the proboscidial fossa is illustrated at the underside of the head, showing the deep groove where the proboscis retracts when not in use. This figure is essential for entomologists and researchers studying bee morphology, providing clear visual references to these specific anatomical features, which are critical for species identification and understanding functional anatomy in bees."

Fig. 4 focuses on the anatomical features of the insect head capsule, specifically highlighting the malar and genal areas. The figure is a detailed diagram that labels and illustrates two key regions: the malar area, defined as the shortest distance between the eye and the mandible, and the genal area, located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. The significance of these areas lies in their role in the structural and functional morphology of the insect head, influencing aspects such as feeding mechanics and sensory input. The diagram in Fig. 4 serves as a crucial reference for understanding the spatial relationships and anatomical details of these regions, which are essential for studies in entomology and related fields. This figure is particularly valuable for researchers focusing on the comparative anatomy or evolutionary biology of insects."

Fig. 5 focuses on the detailed anatomy of bee mandibles, highlighting their key components and their roles in feeding behavior. The figure presents a close-up view of the mandibles, which are essential for the bee's chewing mechanism. Each mandible is labeled to identify specific structures such as the preapical teeth, which are crucial for grasping and manipulating food particles. The diagram also illustrates the articulation points that allow the mandibles to move efficiently, essential for the bee's ability to chew and process various materials. This figure serves as an educational tool to understand the complexity and functionality of bee mouthparts, following the naming conventions established by Michener and Fraser (1978). The clear labeling and detailed depiction emphasize the mandibles' adaptation to the bee's ecological needs, particularly in feeding and nest construction."
