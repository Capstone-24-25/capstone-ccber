Fig. 2 provides a detailed illustration of the head capsule of an insect, focusing specifically on the malar area and the foveae. The malar area, a critical anatomical feature, is depicted as the space between the eye and the mandible. This figure highlights the malar area's length, defined as the shortest distance from the lower edge of the eye to the base of the mandible, emphasizing its importance in distinguishing between different insect species. Additionally, the figure includes representations of the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are shown as shallow depressions, typically black in color, which are significant for sensory functions in insects. The clear labeling and focused depiction in Fig. 2 serve as an essential guide for understanding the anatomical structure and variations within the head regions of insects, aiding in species identification and anatomical studies."
MMD-Figures/,15,Image,NA,3,MMD-Figures/page_15_img_3.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_15_img_3.png,"Fig. 3 visually illustrates the anatomical features of the head capsule of a bee, focusing specifically on the genal area and the preoccipital ridge. The genal area is depicted as the region located posterior to the eye and anterior to the preoccipital ridge, highlighting its significance in the overall structure of the head capsule. The preoccipital ridge is shown as a prominent, curved structure that frames the posterior and lateral aspects of the head, providing structural integrity and protection to the head capsule. Additionally, the figure includes a detailed representation of the proboscidial fossa, a deep groove on the underside of the head where the proboscis retracts. This key feature is crucial for understanding the functional morphology related to the feeding mechanisms of the bee. Each labeled component in Fig. 3 is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the bee's head anatomy, emphasizing the integration of protective structures with sensory and feeding apparatuses."

Figure 4 provides a detailed anatomical illustration of the insect head capsule, focusing on the malar and genal areas. The figure highlights two key regions: the malar area, defined as the shortest distance from the eye to the mandible, and the genal area, located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. These areas are critical for understanding the structural adaptations of the insect's head related to feeding mechanics and sensory modalities. The malar area is particularly noted for its width, which corresponds to the base width of the mandible, indicating its role in mandibular movement and stability. The genal area, adjacent to the preoccipital ridge, supports the lateral and posterior portions of the head, suggesting its importance in protecting the brain and attaching muscles that control head movement. This figure serves as an essential reference for entomologists studying head morphology and its functional implications in various insect species."
MMD-Figures/,16,Image,NA,5,MMD-Figures/page_16_img_5.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_16_img_5.png,"**Figure Description of Fig. 5: Detailed Anatomy of Bee Mandibles**

Figure 5 focuses on the detailed anatomy of bee mandibles, highlighting their structural components and functionality in nectar consumption. The figure is a detailed diagram that labels key parts of the mandibles, which are critical for the bee's feeding mechanisms. Notable components include the preapical teeth and various other mandibular structures that are essential for the chewing and manipulation of food sources. Each labeled part is clearly marked to show its location and relationship to other mandibular features. This diagram serves as an educational tool to understand the complexity and efficiency of bee mouthparts, following the naming conventions established by Michener and Fraser (1978). The figure is essential for entomologists and anyone studying the morphological adaptations of bees that facilitate their feeding habits."
