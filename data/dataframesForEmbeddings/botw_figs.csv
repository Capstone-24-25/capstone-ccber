BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,23,Image,NA,7-2,BOTW-Figures/page_23_img_7-2.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_23_img_7-2.png,"Figure 7-2 illustrates the architectural variations in the nests of the eucerine bee, Peponapis fervens, as excavated in Brazilian soil. The figure prominently features a mature nest alongside examples of newer nests. The mature nest is depicted with obscured lateral burrows filled with earth, indicating the nests' aging process and the natural degradation or reclamation by the surrounding soil. In contrast, the newer nests each show a single, clearly visible lateral burrow, which is newly constructed and not yet provisioned. This distinction highlights the developmental stages of the nest architecture from initial construction to more advanced maturity. The diagram effectively captures the spatial arrangement and structural changes in the bee nests over time, emphasizing the ecological and biological adaptations of Peponapis fervens in their natural habitat. This visual representation aids in understanding the complexity and variability of nest construction among these bees, including aspects like the separation and orientation of lateral burrows and the potential for various cell configurations."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,24,Image,NA,7-3,BOTW-Figures/page_24_img_7-3.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_24_img_7-3.png,"Figure 7-3 illustrates a diagram of three subterranean nests of the colonial halictine bee, Halictus ligatus Say, as excavated in soil in Trinidad, highlighting the sessile nature of the cells. The figure effectively shows the spatial arrangement and developmental stages within the nests. Each cell, represented in the diagram, varies in content, which is distinctly labeled to indicate its current status: cells marked with 'e' are empty, 'E' denotes the presence of an egg, 'SL' stands for small larva, 'ML' indicates a medium-sized larva, and 'PP' represents a large larva. Additionally, some cells are shown with dots, signifying that they were abandoned and are now filled with earth. This diagram serves as a clear visual representation of the developmental progression and occupancy status of the bee cells within these nests, providing insights into the life cycle and nesting behavior of Halictus ligatus."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,25,Image,NA,7-5,BOTW-Figures/page_25_img_7-5.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_25_img_7-5.png,"Figure 7-5 illustrates the nests of Augochlorella striata (Provancher) as excavated into the soil, highlighting the construction and arrangement of bee nesting cells. The figure is divided into two main parts: on the left, a cluster of cells is shown exposed by digging, revealing the intricate network and organization within the nest. At the center of the figure, a more detailed view of a single nest structure is presented, emphasizing the smooth, earthen lining and the application of a waxlike material which is crucial for the structural integrity and protective environment of the nest. This visual representation serves to refute the views of Radchenko and Pesenko (1994a) by clearly depicting the sophisticated construction techniques employed by these bees, contrary to the claims that such construction does not occur. The figure effectively demonstrates the natural engineering skills of Augochlorella striata in nest building, providing a clear and detailed view of their subterranean architecture."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,26,Image,NA,7-6,BOTW-Figures/page_26_img_7-6.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_26_img_7-6.png,"Figure 7-6 illustrates parts of three nests of the bee species Heriades spiniscutis (Cameron) located in dead, dry stems. This figure is significant for demonstrating the nesting behavior of this species, particularly in how they construct their nests with or without partitions. The nest on the right side of the figure features thin partitions made of pith fragments, which are indicated by horizontal lines. These partitions separate individual cells within the nest. In contrast, the other two nests shown in the figure do not have any partitions between their cells. This variation highlights different nesting strategies within the same species, possibly influenced by environmental factors or material availability. The figure serves as a visual case study of the architectural diversity in nest construction among Megachiline bees, specifically pointing out the use of natural materials like pith fragments and the choice to include or omit partitions between cells."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,34,Image,NA,8-1,BOTW-Figures/page_34_img_8-1.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_34_img_8-1.png,"Figure 8-1 illustrates the proboscis structures of parasitic and nonparasitic allodapine bees, focusing on comparative anatomy to highlight evolutionary adaptations. The figure is divided into three parts, each depicting the maxilla (left) and labium (right) of different bee species. The first two parts, labeled (a) and (b), show the proboscis structures of the social parasites Eucondylops reducta Michener and Nasutapis straussorum Michener, respectively. The third part, labeled (c), presents the proboscis of the nonparasitic species Allodapula melanopus (Cameron).

Key features include the visibly reduced and simplified structures in the parasitic species compared to the more complex and elongated structures in the nonparasitic species. This reduction in the parasitic species is significant as it suggests an evolutionary adaptation possibly linked to their lifestyle, which relies less on nectar collection from flowers and more on interactions within host bee colonies. All drawings are to the same scale, emphasizing the size reduction in the proboscis of parasitic species relative to the nonparasitic species, despite the similar body sizes of these bees. This comparison provides insights into the morphological changes associated with parasitic versus nonparasitic life strategies in bees."
