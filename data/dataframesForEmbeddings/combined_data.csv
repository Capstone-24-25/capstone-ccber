MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ Chapter 4 — A primer on bee morphology

v [updated 6/28/2022]

~ In order to use the keys in this book effectively, it is important to become familiar with

~ the morphology of bees and the terms used to describe morphological features. With that goal in

iJ mind, we present below an overview of bee morphology and an introduction to the terms that are
used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based

~ on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener’s PhD thesis (Michener 1944).

~ Additional key papers on bee morphology include Urban (1967), Camargo et al. (1967),",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"wv Eickwort (1969), Stephen et al. (1969), and Brooks (1988). The illustrations in this chapter are
redrawn from Michener (1944 and 1965a) and Danforth (1996). For a detailed look at the

~ internal and external anatomy of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), see Snodgrass (1956). For a

~ comprehensive and modern overview of general insect morphology, see Beutel et al. (2014).

¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.

9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

~ For use of the keys, it will be important to identify specific metasomal terga or sterna. To do so,",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the

first metasoma tergum is T1, the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first ~
metasomal sternum is S1, the second S2, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are ~
comfortable with identifying specific metasomal terga and sterna when you start using the keys. wi",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"The sexes in bees are often quite different from one ~
another, and in parts of the keys the sexes are treated atl
separately. To people familiar with bees, males and females ~
can be distinguished most rapidly based on the overall shape ww
of the body — males are typically more slender than females
and they often have longer antennae. Also, the presence of a ~
distinct scopa will distinguish females from males in many ~
groups (excluding brood parasites, bees that carry pollen v
internally, and queens of advanced eusocial species). Finally,
females have stings, and males have male genitalia [Fig. 20]; ~
but both are commonly retracted, and in some females the ~
sting is rudimentary. Other features may need to be examined ¥
to verify the sex of an individual, including the number of",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"antennal segments and the number of visible metasomal ~
segments. Males have 13 antennal segments (12 in Neopasites ~
and Holcopasites);, females have 12 [Fig. 10]. In addition, ~
males and females typically differ in the number of visible ws
metasomal segments. In males, we can usually count seven
visible metasomal terga, whereas in females we can usually ~
count only six [Fig. 19]. But keep in mind that the last ad
segment, which often bears a pygidial plate, can be hidden. In ed
female Halictinae, for example, T6 is often hidden beneath
T5, so females appear to have just five visible terga. Likewise, ~
in some male bees it is difficult to see T7 because it is largely, ”
or rarely wholly, hidden beneath T6. In addition, in males of ~
some groups (e.g., Osmiini) the segments are greatly",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"telescoped and retracted so that the visible terga and sterna ~
can be reduced to as few as four visible sterna and terga. ~
HEAD CAPSULE (Figs 2-4, 10)",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"The malar area [Fig. 2] is the space between the eye and the mandible; its length is the =
shortest distance from the eye to the mandible [Fig. 4]; the width of this area is the width of the —
base of the mandible. The foveae (singular: fovea) of the face [Fig. 2] and of the sides of the
second metasomal tergum (T2) are shallow depressions, usually black in color, with a texture ~
distinct from the surrounding cuticle, and variable in shape. The term orbit is often used for the ~
eye margin, inner orbit for the frontal or facial margin, and outer orbit for the genal margin. The ~
genal area is the region behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge [Figs. 3 and 4]. The v
ridge surrounding the concave posterior surface of the head above and laterally is called the",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,preoccipital ridge [Fig. 3]. A carina sometimes found on this ridge is the preoccipital carina. The ~,,,,

~ underside of the head into which the proboscis
~ folds [Fig. 3].
MOUTHPARTS (Figs. 5-9)
~ Bee mouthparts consist of paired mandibles
~ for chewing and a proboscis that can fold and

names of mandibular structures [Fig. 5], we usually
~ follow Michener and Fraser (1978). For simplicity
~ we often refer to preapical teeth on the upper
7 margin instead of teeth of the pollex. Other terms used herein are the condylar ridge, which
arises near the mandibular condyle and extends toward the apex of the mandible, and the outer
~ ridge, which is the next ridge above the condylar ridge on the outer surface of the mandible.",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"~ The bee proboscis is a complex structure formed from a fusion of the maxilla and labium,
we which together make up the “labiomaxillary complex.” The maxilla consists of paired cardines
(singular: cardo) that suspend the labiomaxillary complex from beneath the head capsule, the
~ stipes, blade-like galea (plural: galeae), and the maxillary palpus (plural: palpi) with up to six
~ segments [Figs. 6, 7]. Attached at the apex of the
hs cardines is the labium, which consists of the lorum,
e mentum, prementum, tongue-like glossa, and (typically)
four-segmented labial palpus [Fig. 6]. In Colletidae the
~ glossa is quite different from that of other bees [Fig. 8,
~ 9]. Rather than being slender and elongate, as in most
ka other bee families, the colletid glossa is short and",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"bilobed (sometimes referred to as “bifid”). This
~ modification of the glossa is related to the application of
a the thick, cellophane brood cell lining that characterizes
~ colletid bees (Batra 1980).
Bees can be divided into two broad categories
~ based on mouthpart morphology: short-tongued bees
~ (Andrenidae, Halictidae, Colletidae, Stenotritidae, and
~ Melittidae), in which the labial palpal segments are all
v similar in morphology (Fig. 8), and long-tongued bees
(Apidae and Megachilidae), in which the first two labial
~ palpal segments are slender and blade-like (Fig. 6).
~ Danforth et al. (2019) provide a more detailed
_ description of the proboscis and how it functions.
The proboscis is typically folded beneath the
~ head capsule, making it very difficult to distinguish",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"~ among the complex and interconnected elements.
~ However, if the mouthparts are pulled before pinning, while the specimen is still flexible, the
o individual elements can be easily recognized. In some cases, it is necessary to examine the
maxillary and labial palpi and to count the number of palpal segments (e.g., in certain Eucerini).
~ It can also be useful to be able to identify the blade-like, first two labial palpal segments in long-",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"tongued bees as a tool for knowing whether you are examining a short-tongued or long-tongued
bee. But this is by no means essential for using the keys to the genera. Chapter 11 (Key to the ~
Families of North and Central America), however, makes heavy use of mouthpart characters ~
because these characters are defining features of the bee families. sl
MESOSOMA (Figs. 11-18) ~
The mesosoma is a compact structure consisting of sclerites of the pro-, meso- and ~
metathoracic segments, which bear the legs and wings, and the first true abdominal segment, WJ
termed the propodeum [Figs. 13 and 14]. The prothorax in bees is represented primarily by the
large pronotum, which extends laterally and meets ventrally behind the forecoxae, forming a ~",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"tubelike structure. The pronotal lobe is a useful landmark, and its shape and location may be used ~
in generic identification. The mesothorax and metathorax bear the wings and the second and is
third pairs of legs. In dorsal view [Fig. 14], the mesothorax can be divided into four distinct
sclerites: the scutum, the scutellum, and paired axillae. Dorsally, the metathorax consists of a ~
single sclerite, the metanotum. Laterally [Fig. 13], the mesothorax is represented by the ~
mesepisternum, sometimes referred to as the mesopleuron. The mesepisternum is sometimes ~
divided by the pre-episternal groove into the pre-episternum (or pre-episternal area) and the rest
of the mesepisternum. The shape and location of the pre-episternal groove, the scrobal groove, ~",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"and the scrobe are often important in generic identification. The metepisternum (or metapleuron) ~
forms the lateral surface of the metathorax. The wing bases are located above the upper margins ~
of the mesepisternum and the metepisternum. Js
<a
~
The form and subdivisions of the propodeum are not easy to illustrate but are exceedingly ~
important for identification. Many bees have a pair of impressed lines on the propodeum, Ww
beginning near the anterior dorsolateral parts of the propodeum and extending downward and
posteromesially and nearly meeting in the propodeal pit [Fig. 149], a median depression of the ~
lower posterior surface. These lines, together with the anterior dorsal margin of the propodeum, ~",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"enclose the triangular area, or propodeal triangle [Fig. 149]. Morphologically, this triangle is the ww
metapostnotum (Brothers 1976). The shape of the propodeum as seen in profile is quite
independent of the triangle. The whole propodeum may be vertical or nearly so, dropping from ~
the posterior margin of the metanotum. In this case it is termed declivous. However, as in Fig. ~
13, there may be a more or less horizontal basal region. In Fig. 13 it is separated by a sharp line, ~",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,5,Text,"~ or carina, from the declivous posterior surface. When such is the case, the horizontal part is
~ called the basal zone, or basal area, of the propodeum [Fig. 13]. It is part of the propodeal
~ triangle. The term ""basal area"" is applicable even if no
es sharp line separates the horizontal from the vertical
surfaces. In some bees the two surfaces are continuously
~ rounded, one onto the other in a broad curving surface; in
~ that case the term “basal area” is not definable unless there
~ is distinctive surface sculpturing.",,,,

~ Figs. 15 and 16, using a modified Comstock and Needham

~ morphologically noncommittal for certain cells and veins
ad heavily used in taxonomy. The names of cells and certain

~ Of special importance are three veins that all look

¥ and second r-m (or third transverse cubital), to use the
Comstock and Needham system. These veins help to
~ define the submarginal cells, which are usually either
~ three or two in number. It is important to note that
- submarginal cells can be variable within species. While
the vast majority of individuals within a species exhibit",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,5,Text,"~ the “typical” wing venation pattern for that species, there
~ are developmental anomalies that can result in non-
ww typical patterns of wing venation. Scarpulla (2018)
identified a number of such wing vein anomalies in
~ species of Colletidae, Andrenidae, Halictidae and
~ Apidae. These wing vein anomalies are commonly
~ expressed as a loss of the second transverse cubital vein
o in which a bee species that typically has three
submarginal cells instead has two. In some cases individuals can have normal wing venation on
~ one side of the body and non-typical wing venation on the other. If you suspect you have a
~ specimen with such a wing vein anomaly, the best solution is to compare it to other individuals

~ Each metasomal tergum or sternum (except for the anteriormost and the reduced apical

» ends of the tergal graduli, unless bent strongly to the rear, are usually near the spiracles. If bent
~ strongly to the rear, the resultant longitudinal lines are called lateral parts or lateral arms of the
graduli or, if carinate, lateral gradular carinae. The area anterior to the gradulus is usually at a",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,7,Text,"~ slightly higher level than that posterior to it, so that the gradulus is like a minute step. The
~ elevated, pre-gradular area provides a smooth surface for the anterior tergum or sternum to move

- metasoma but, especially on the second tergum and sternum, are sometimes exposed. (3) Near
the posterior margin of each tergum and sternum is usually another transverse line, the

Head, antennae, and mouthparts

' Wings'

(Figs. 13-19)

The system used here for naming wing veins

(1898-1899) system updated by Comstock (1918),
Ross (1936) and others (see Mason 1990 for
additional references). Unfortunately, there are",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4,Text,"> other systems employed by hymenopterists such as
the Rohwer-Gahan (1916) system widely used for
the Ichneumonoidea. The authors of the chapters

s on Apoidea, Chrysidoidea, and Vespoidea prefer a

a different system of naming wing cells. One reason

8, for this, given by Michener (p. 310 in this
publication), is that it is sometimes impossible to
determine the true origins of some wing cells. For
example, the three submarginal cells of most
aculeate Hymenoptera are 1R1, 1Rs, and 2Rs.
When the number is reduced to two, one cannot",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4,Text,": determine whether the missing vein is the second
abscissa of Rs or Ir-m. Therefore, when naming
these cells, the use of the generic term submarginal
is more practical than the more specific terms 1R1,
1Rs and 2Rs. For comparison, the equivalent (when
the complete complement of three cells is present)
names of veins and cells used in the Comstock-
Needham system are tabulated in Chapter 7
(p. 130). For a comparison of the updated
Comstock-Needham system and other systems see

In many small parasitic Hymenoptera (¢.g.,",,,,

Platygastroidea, and some Chrysidoidea) the wing

Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,3,Text,"1. About Bees and This Book
Since ancient times, people have been drawn to the study
of bees. Bees are spritely creatures that move about on
pleasant bright days and visit pretty flowers. Anyone
studying their behavior should find them attractive,
partly because they work in warm sunny places, during
pleasant seasons and times of day. The sights and odors of
the fieldwork ambience contribute to the well-being of
any researcher. Moreover, bees are important pollinators
of both natural vegetation and crops, and certain kinds of
bees make useful products, especially honey and wax. But
quite apart from their practical importance, at least since
the time of Aristotle people have been interested in bees
because they are fascinating creatures. We are social ani-",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,3,Text,"mals; some bees are also social. Their interactions and
communications, which make their colonial life func-
tion, have long been matters of interest; we wonder how
a tiny brain can react appropriately to societal problems
similar to those faced by other social animals, such as hu-
mans. Fora biologist or natural historian, bees are also fas-
cinating because of their many adaptations to diverse
flowers; their ability to find food and nesting materials
and carry them over great distances back to a nest; their
ability to remember where resources were found and re-
turn to them; their architectural devices, which permit
food storage, for example, in warm, moist soil full of bac-
teria and fungi; and their ability to rob the nests of oth-
ers, some species having become obligate robbers and",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,3,Text,"others cuckoolike parasites. These are only a few of the in-
teresting things that bees do.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,3,Text,"I consider myself fortunate to work with such a bio-
logically diverse group of insects, one of which is the com-
mon honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. In terms of phys-
iology and behavior, it is the best-known insect. Educated
guesses about what happens in another bee species are of-
ten possible because we know so much about Apis mellif-
era. In this book, however, Apis is treated briefly, like all
other bee taxa, its text supplemented by references to
books on Apis biology; the greater part of this book con-
cerns bees (the great majority) that are not social.",,,,

especially social and parasitic behavior, nest architecture,
and ecology, including floral associations, are indicated.
Major papers on bee nesting biology and floral relation-
ships are also cited. The reader can thus use this book as
a guide to the extensive literature on bee biology. Because
the male genitalia and associated sterna of bees provide
characters useful at all levels, from species to family, and
because they are often complex and difficult to describe,

to publications in which others are illustrated.",,,,

naturalists who wish to know about the diversity and
habits of bees. Such users may not be greatly concerned
with details of descriptive material and keys, but should
be able to gain a sense of the taxonomic, morphological,
and behavioral diversity of the bee faunas with which they
work. As major pollinators, bees are especially important
to pollination biologists. I hope that by providing infor-
mation on the diversity of bees and their classification and
identification, this book will in some mostly indirect ways
contribute to pollination biology.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,3,Text,"To a significant degree, studies of bees, especially non-
taxonomic studies, have developed in Russia more or less
independently from those in the rest of the world. Itis for-
tunate, therefore, that a huge list of publications by Rus-
sian authors and others in the former U.S.S.R., with sum-
maries in English, has recently been published (Pesenko
and Astafurova, 2003). This large work, covering the pe-
riod from 1771 to 2002 provides information on 3,027
publications by 1,126 authors. Michener (2000) and
many earlier works utilized the publications in Russian

Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,2. What Are Bees?,,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"A major group of the order Hymenoptera is the Section
Aculeata, i-e., Hymenoptera whose females have stings—
modifications of the ovipositors of ancestral groups of
Hymenoptera. The Aculeata include the wasps, ants, and
bees. Bees are similar to one group of wasps, the sphecoid
wasps, but are quite unlike other Aculeata. Bees are usu-
ally more robust and hairy than wasps (see Pls. 3-15), but
some bees (e.g., Hylaeus, Pl. 1; Nomada, P|. 2) are slender,
sparsely haired, and sometimes wasplike even in col-
oration. Bees differ from nearly all wasps in their depen-
dence on pollen collected from flowers as a protein source
to feed their larvae and probably also for ovarian devel-
opment by egg-laying females. (An exception is a small
clade of meliponine bees of the genus Trigona, which use",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"carrion instead of pollen.) Unlike the sphecoid wasps,
bees do not capture spiders or insects to provide food for
their offspring. Thus nearly all bees are plant feeders; they
have abandoned the ancestral carnivorous behavior of
sphecoid wasp larvae. (Adult wasps, like bees, often visit
flowers for nectar; adult sphecoid wasps do not collect or
eat pollen.)",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"Bees and the sphecoid wasps together constitute the
superfamily Apoidea (formerly called Sphecoidea, but see
Michener, 1986a). The Apoidea as a whole can be recog-
nized by a number of characters, of which two are the
most conspicuous: (1) the posterior pronotal lobe is dis-
tinct but rather small, usually well separated from and be-
low the tegula; and (2) the pronotum extends ventrally as
a pair of processes, one on each side, that encircle or nearly
encircle the thorax behind the front coxae. See Section 10
for explanations of morphological terms and Section 12
for more details about the Apoidea as a whole.

As indicated above, the Apoidea are divisible into two",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"groups: the sphecoid (or apoid) wasps, or Spheciformes,
and the bees, or Apiformes (Brothers, 1975). Older au-
thors also used the term Anthophila for the bees and the
name was resurrected by Engel (2005); Apiformes is a ju-
nior synonym of Anthophila. No priority rules govern
such names. I prefer Apiformes because it contrasts well
with Spheciformes and because the word itself makes its
meaning immediately clear. Structural characters of bees
that help to distinguish them from sphecoid wasps are (1)
the presence of branched, often plumose, hairs, and (2)
the hind basitarsi, which are broader than the succeeding
tarsal segments. The proboscis is in general longer than
that of most sphecoid wasps. The details, and other char-
acteristics of bees, are explained in Section 12.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"A conveniently visible character that easily distin-
guishes nearly all bees from most sphecoid wasps is the
golden or silvery hairs on the lower face of most such
wasps, causing the face to glitter in the light. Bees almost
never exhibit this characteristic, because their facial hairs
are duller, often erect, often plumose, or largely absent.
This feature is especially useful in distinguishing small,
wasplike bees such as Hylaeus from similar-looking sphe-
coid wasps such as the Pemphredoninae.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,5,Text,"The monophyletic Apiformes is believed to have arisen
from the paraphyletic Spheciformes. Monophyletic is
used here in the strict sense sometimes called Holo-
phyletic. Such a group (1) arose from a single ancestor
that would be considered a member of the group, and (2)
includes all taxa derived from that ancestor. Groups
termed Paraphyletic also arose from such an ancestor but
do not include all of the derived taxa. Brief explanations
of other terms used by systematists are appended to Sec-
tion 12.

Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"3. The Importance of Bees
Probably the most important activity of bees, in terms of
benefits to humans, is their pollination of natural vegeta-
tion, something that is rarely observed by nonspecialists
and is almost never appreciated; see Section 6. Of course
the products of honey bees—i.e., wax and honey plus
small quantities of royal jelly—are of obvious bernefit,
but are of trivial value compared to the profoundly im-
portant role of bees as pollinators. Most of the tree species
of tropical forests are insect-pollinated, and that usually
means bee-pollinated. A major study of tropical forest
pollination was summarized by Frankie et al. (1990); see
also Jones and Little (1983), Roubik (1989), and Bawa
(1990). In temperate climates, most forest trees (pines,",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"oaks, etc.) are wind-pollinated, but many kinds of bushes,
small trees, and herbaceous plants, including many wild
flowers, are bee-pollinated. Desertic and xeric scrub areas
are extremely rich in bee-pollinated plants whose preser-
vation and reproduction may be essential in preventing
erosion and other problems, and in providing food and
cover for wildlife. Conservation of many habitats thus de-
pends upon preservation of bee populations, for if the
bees disappear, reproduction of major elements of the
flora may be severely limited.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Closer to our immediate needs, many cultivated plants
are also bee-pollinated, or they are horticultural varieties
of bee-pollinated plants. Maintenance of the wild, bee-
pollinated populations is thus important for the genetic
diversity needed to improve the cultivated strains. Gar-
den flowers, most fruits, most vegetables, many fiber
crops like flax and cotton, and major forage crops such as
alfalfa and clover are bee-pollinated.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Some plants require bee pollination in order to pro-
duce fruit. Others, commonly bee-pollinated, can self
pollinate if no bees arrive; but inbreeding depression is a
frequent result. Thus crops produced by such plants are
usually better if bee-pollinated than if not; that is, the
numbers of seeds or sizes of fruits are enhanced by polli-
nation. Estimates made in the late 1980s of the value of
insect-pollinated crops (mostly by bees) in the USA
ranged from $4.6 to $18.9 billion, depending on various
assumptions on what should be included and how the es-
timate should be calculated. Also doubtful is the estimate
that 80 percent of the crop pollination by bees is by honey
bees, the rest mostly by wild bees. But whatever estimates
one prefers, bee pollination is crucially important (see",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"O'Toole, 1993, for review), and the acreages and values
of insect-pollinated crops are increasing year by year.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Wild bees may now become even more important as
pollinators than in the past, because of the dramatic de-
crease in feral honey bee populations in north-temperate
climates due to the introduction into Europe and the
Americas of mites such as Varroa and tracheal mites,
which are parasites of honey bees. Moreover, there are var-
ious crops for which honey bees are poor pollinators com-
pared to wild bees. Examples of wild bees already com-
mercially used are Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski),
which pollinates fruit trees in Japan; Megachile rotundata
(Fabricius), which pollinates alfalfa in many areas; Bom-

Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"bus terrestris (Linnaeus), which pollinates tomatoes in Eu-
ropean greenhouses, and other Bombusspecies that do the
same job elsewhere. O’ Toole (1993) has given an account
of wild bee species that are important in agriculture, and
the topic was further considered by Parker, Batra, and Te-
pedino (1987), Torchio (1991), and Richards (1993).
Since honey bees do not sonicate tubular anthers to ob-
tain pollen (i.e., they do not buzz-pollinate; see Sec. 6),
they are not effective pollinators of Ericaceae, such as
blueberries and cranberries, or Solanaceae such as egg-
plants, chilis, and tomatoes.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Many bees are pollen specialists on particular kinds of
flowers, and even among generalists, different kinds of
bees have different but often strong preferences. There-
fore, anyone investigating the importance of wild bees as
pollinators needs to know about kinds of bees. The clas-
sification presented by this book can suggest species to
consider; for example, if one bee is a good legume polli-
nator, a related one is likely to have similar behavior. Pro-
boscis length is an important factor in these considera-
tions, fora bee witha short proboscis usually cannot reach
nectar in a deep flower, and probably will not take pollen
there either, so is unlikely to be a significant pollinator of
such a plant.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Although some bees, e.g., Euglossini and many
Meliponini, inhabit undisturbed forests, especially in the
tropics, many and probably most bee species inhabit sa-
vannas and forest margins and thrive in moderately dis-
turbed areas. Temperate forests were presumably never
good places for most bees since they consist largely of trees
that do not produce flowers visited by bees. There were
probably fewer bees in primeval temperate forests than
now inhabit the same areas. Now, with pastures, waste
lands, road and field margins, and forests that have been
opened by cutting, once scarce species of bees have be-
come abundant and presumably play important roles as
pollinators of the vegetation. Even unbroken prairie ap-
pears to have fewer bees than more or less abandoned dis-",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"turbed areas. Thus Laroca (1983) found more species and
individuals in a little used, often disturbed university
campus area, not planted with lawn or other vegetation,
than in nearby prairie in Kansas. Of course the bees in
such areas are the species that may pollinate agricultural
crops or ornamental plants and, therefore, may be se-
lected for practical use as pollinators.",,,,
Bees of the World,2007,Daniel C. Danforth,BOTWPublisher,6,Text,"Although disturbed areas often have more bees than
undisturbed areas, it does not follow, of course, that the
more disturbance, the better for the bees. When a whole
area becomes a monoculture of corn or any other crop,
most bees become dependant on small waste areas or road
verges, and with small isolated populations, the number
of species and individuals will soon be reduced.

In many countries the populations of wild bees have

few loci; heterozygosity at the sex-determining locus (or
loci) produces females. Development without fertiliza-
tion, i.e., with the haploid number of chromosomes, pro-
duces males, since heterozygosity is impossible. Inbreed-
ing results in some diploid eggs that are homozygous at

are larger than worker-producing cells and presumably it
is the cell size that stimulates the queen to fertilize or not

cells in series in burrows, the female can place male-pro-

The late-embryonic developmentand hatching of eggs",,,,

mersed in paraffin oil to render the chorion transparent.
Before hatching, the embryo rotates on its long axis, ei-
ther 90° or 180°. In some bees (e.g., Nomadinae) the
chorion at hatching is dissolved around the spiracles, then

grow rapidly, molting about four times as they do so. The
shed skins are so insubstantial and hard to observe that
for the great majority of bees the number of molts is un-
