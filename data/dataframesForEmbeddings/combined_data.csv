MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"~ mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

~ For use of the keys, it will be important to identify specific metasomal terga or sterna. To do so,",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the

first metasoma tergum is T1, the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first ~
metasomal sternum is S1, the second S2, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are ~
comfortable with identifying specific metasomal terga and sterna when you start using the keys. wi",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"The sexes in bees are often quite different from one ~
another, and in parts of the keys the sexes are treated atl
separately. To people familiar with bees, males and females ~
can be distinguished most rapidly based on the overall shape ww
of the body — males are typically more slender than females
and they often have longer antennae. Also, the presence of a ~",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"distinct scopa will distinguish females from males in many ~
groups (excluding brood parasites, bees that carry pollen v
internally, and queens of advanced eusocial species). Finally,
females have stings, and males have male genitalia [Fig. 20]; ~

MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"to verify the sex of an individual, including the number of
antennal segments and the number of visible metasomal ~
segments. Males have 13 antennal segments (12 in Neopasites ~
and Holcopasites);, females have 12 [Fig. 10]. In addition, ~
males and females typically differ in the number of visible ws
metasomal segments. In males, we can usually count seven",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"visible metasomal terga, whereas in females we can usually ~
count only six [Fig. 19]. But keep in mind that the last ad
segment, which often bears a pygidial plate, can be hidden. In ed
female Halictinae, for example, T6 is often hidden beneath
T5, so females appear to have just five visible terga. Likewise, ~
in some male bees it is difficult to see T7 because it is largely, ”",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"or rarely wholly, hidden beneath T6. In addition, in males of ~
some groups (e.g., Osmiini) the segments are greatly
telescoped and retracted so that the visible terga and sterna ~
can be reduced to as few as four visible sterna and terga. ~

MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"The malar area [Fig. 2] is the space between the eye and the mandible; its length is the =

hs cardines is the labium, which consists of the lorum,
e mentum, prementum, tongue-like glossa, and (typically)
four-segmented labial palpus [Fig. 6]. In Colletidae the
~ glossa is quite different from that of other bees [Fig. 8,

' Wings'

(Figs. 13-19)

The system used here for naming wing veins

y and cells is the Comstock and Needham
(1898-1899) system updated by Comstock (1918),
Ross (1936) and others (see Mason 1990 for
additional references). Unfortunately, there are

> other systems employed by hymenopterists such as
the Rohwer-Gahan (1916) system widely used for
the Ichneumonoidea. The authors of the chapters",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4.0,Text,"s on Apoidea, Chrysidoidea, and Vespoidea prefer a

a different system of naming wing cells. One reason

8, for this, given by Michener (p. 310 in this
publication), is that it is sometimes impossible to
determine the true origins of some wing cells. For
example, the three submarginal cells of most
aculeate Hymenoptera are 1R1, 1Rs, and 2Rs.
When the number is reduced to two, one cannot",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4.0,Text,": determine whether the missing vein is the second
abscissa of Rs or Ir-m. Therefore, when naming
these cells, the use of the generic term submarginal
is more practical than the more specific terms 1R1,
1Rs and 2Rs. For comparison, the equivalent (when
the complete complement of three cells is present)
names of veins and cells used in the Comstock-
Needham system are tabulated in Chapter 7",,,,

Danforth illustrates the underground nest structures of the eucerine bee, Peponapis fervens, in Brazil. The figure presents a mature nest alongside newer nests, showcasing variations in nest architecture. The mature nest is depicted with obscured lateral burrows filled with earth, indicating the nest's evolutionary adaptation to protect its structure and contents. In contrast, the newer nests each feature a single, clearly visible lateral burrow, which is newly constructed and unprovisioned. This comparison highlights the developmental stages of the nest and the bee's method of expanding and securing its reproductive site. The diagram serves as a visual explanation of the nesting behavior of Peponapis fervens, emphasizing the strategic placement and construction of lateral burrows to optimize survival and reproduction."

Danforth illustrates the nesting structure of the colonial halictine bee, Halictus ligatus Say, as excavated in soil in Trinidad. This diagram specifically focuses on the arrangement of sessile cells within the nest. The figure effectively shows the spatial layout and developmental stages of the bee larvae within these cells. Key labeled components include cells marked with dots, which represent abandoned, earth-filled cells. Other cells are labeled to indicate their contents: 'e' for empty, 'E' for egg, 'SL' for small larva, 'ML' for medium-sized larva, and 'PP' for a large larva, usually in the prepupal stage. This detailed labeling helps in understanding the life cycle stages and nest occupancy, providing insights into the reproductive and developmental biology of Halictus ligatus. The diagram serves as a valuable visual aid for comprehending the complex life processes and nest architecture of this bee species."

Danforth illustrates the nests of Augochlorella striata (Provancher) excavated into soil. The figure features two main components: at the left, a cluster of cells exposed by digging, and at the center, a detailed view of a single nest. These components highlight the construction techniques of Augochlorella striata, showcasing the smooth earthen layers lining the cells and the application of a waxlike material. This figure effectively demonstrates the natural engineering skills of these bees, emphasizing their ability to modify and utilize soil materials to create protective environments for their offspring. The visual representation aids in understanding the text's discussion on the nesting behavior of soil-excavating bees and refutes earlier views that such sophisticated construction does not occur."

Danforth illustrates the nesting behavior of Heriades spiniscutis (Cameron) in dead, dry stems. This figure provides a visual comparison of three different nests, highlighting variations in construction techniques within the species. One nest, located on the right side of the figure, features thin partitions made of pith fragments between the cells, which are indicated by horizontal lines. The other two nests depicted do not have any partitions between the cells. This figure effectively demonstrates the variability in cell partitioning in Megachilidae bee nests, specifically showing how Heriades spiniscutis may or may not use partitions, which are crucial for understanding nesting ecology and behavior in this species. The figure underscores the adaptability and resource utilization of these bees in their natural habitat."

Danforth illustrates the proboscidial structures of parasitic and nonparasitic allodapine bees, focusing on the maxilla and labium. This figure compares the anatomical features of two parasitic species, Eucondylops reducta Michener and Nasutapis straussorum Michener (labeled as a and b), with those of a nonparasitic species, Allodapula melanopus (Cameron), labeled as c. The key components highlighted are the maxilla (left side of each pair) and the labium (right side of each pair), which are essential for feeding behaviors in bees. The illustration is scaled uniformly across all species to emphasize the morphological differences, particularly showing the reduction in size of these structures in the parasitic species compared to the nonparasitic species. This visual comparison underscores evolutionary adaptations linked to the bees' parasitic or nonparasitic lifestyles."
