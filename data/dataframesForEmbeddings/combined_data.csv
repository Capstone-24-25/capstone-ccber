The mesosoma is a compact structure consisting of sclerites of the pro-, meso- and ~

sclerites: the scutum, the scutellum, and paired axillae. Dorsally, the metathorax consists of a ~",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,3,Text,"single sclerite, the metanotum. Laterally [Fig. 13], the mesothorax is represented by the ~
mesepisternum, sometimes referred to as the mesopleuron. The mesepisternum is sometimes ~

of the mesepisternum. The shape and location of the pre-episternal groove, the scrobal groove, ~",NA,NA,NA,NA

Figure 4 provides a detailed anatomical illustration of the insect head capsule, focusing on the malar and genal areas. The figure highlights two key regions: the malar area, defined as the shortest distance from the eye to the mandible, and the genal area, located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. These areas are critical for understanding the structural adaptations of the insect's head related to feeding mechanics and sensory modalities. The malar area is particularly noted for its width, which corresponds to the base width of the mandible, indicating its role in mandibular movement and stability. The genal area, adjacent to the preoccipital ridge, supports the lateral and posterior portions of the head, suggesting its importance in protecting the brain and attaching muscles that control head movement. This figure serves as an essential reference for entomologists studying head morphology and its functional implications in various insect species."

Figure 5 focuses on the detailed anatomy of bee mandibles, highlighting their structural components and functionality in nectar consumption. The figure is a detailed diagram that labels key parts of the mandibles, which are critical for the bee's feeding mechanisms. Notable components include the preapical teeth and various other mandibular structures that are essential for the chewing and manipulation of food sources. Each labeled part is clearly marked to show its location and relationship to other mandibular features. This diagram serves as an educational tool to understand the complexity and efficiency of bee mouthparts, following the naming conventions established by Michener and Fraser (1978). The figure is essential for entomologists and anyone studying the morphological adaptations of bees that facilitate their feeding habits."

The text explains that the gena refers to the lateral part of the head between the compound eyes, along with descriptions of its position in relation to other parts of the head. The illustrations likely provide visual examples of the concepts described in the text."
