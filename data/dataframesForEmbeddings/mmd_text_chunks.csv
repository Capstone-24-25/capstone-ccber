MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

males and females typically differ in the number of visible ws

count only six [Fig. 19]. But keep in mind that the last ad
segment, which often bears a pygidial plate, can be hidden. In ed
female Halictinae, for example, T6 is often hidden beneath
T5, so females appear to have just five visible terga. Likewise, ~
in some male bees it is difficult to see T7 because it is largely, ”",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"or rarely wholly, hidden beneath T6. In addition, in males of ~
some groups (e.g., Osmiini) the segments are greatly
telescoped and retracted so that the visible terga and sterna ~
can be reduced to as few as four visible sterna and terga. ~
