MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ Chapter 4 — A primer on bee morphology

v [updated 6/28/2022]

~ In order to use the keys in this book effectively, it is important to become familiar with

~ the morphology of bees and the terms used to describe morphological features. With that goal in

iJ mind, we present below an overview of bee morphology and an introduction to the terms that are
used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based

~ on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener’s PhD thesis (Michener 1944).

~ Additional key papers on bee morphology include Urban (1967), Camargo et al. (1967),",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"wv Eickwort (1969), Stephen et al. (1969), and Brooks (1988). The illustrations in this chapter are
redrawn from Michener (1944 and 1965a) and Danforth (1996). For a detailed look at the

~ internal and external anatomy of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), see Snodgrass (1956). For a

~ comprehensive and modern overview of general insect morphology, see Beutel et al. (2014).

¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.

9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

~ For use of the keys, it will be important to identify specific metasomal terga or sterna. To do so,",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the

first metasoma tergum is T1, the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first ~
metasomal sternum is S1, the second S2, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are ~
comfortable with identifying specific metasomal terga and sterna when you start using the keys. wi",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"The sexes in bees are often quite different from one ~
another, and in parts of the keys the sexes are treated atl
separately. To people familiar with bees, males and females ~
can be distinguished most rapidly based on the overall shape ww
of the body — males are typically more slender than females
and they often have longer antennae. Also, the presence of a ~
distinct scopa will distinguish females from males in many ~
groups (excluding brood parasites, bees that carry pollen v
internally, and queens of advanced eusocial species). Finally,
females have stings, and males have male genitalia [Fig. 20]; ~
but both are commonly retracted, and in some females the ~
sting is rudimentary. Other features may need to be examined ¥
to verify the sex of an individual, including the number of",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"antennal segments and the number of visible metasomal ~
segments. Males have 13 antennal segments (12 in Neopasites ~
and Holcopasites);, females have 12 [Fig. 10]. In addition, ~
males and females typically differ in the number of visible ws
metasomal segments. In males, we can usually count seven
visible metasomal terga, whereas in females we can usually ~
count only six [Fig. 19]. But keep in mind that the last ad
segment, which often bears a pygidial plate, can be hidden. In ed
female Halictinae, for example, T6 is often hidden beneath
T5, so females appear to have just five visible terga. Likewise, ~
in some male bees it is difficult to see T7 because it is largely, ”
or rarely wholly, hidden beneath T6. In addition, in males of ~
some groups (e.g., Osmiini) the segments are greatly",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"telescoped and retracted so that the visible terga and sterna ~
can be reduced to as few as four visible sterna and terga. ~
HEAD CAPSULE (Figs 2-4, 10)",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"The malar area [Fig. 2] is the space between the eye and the mandible; its length is the =

base of the mandible. The foveae (singular: fovea) of the face [Fig. 2] and of the sides of the
second metasomal tergum (T2) are shallow depressions, usually black in color, with a texture ~
distinct from the surrounding cuticle, and variable in shape. The term orbit is often used for the ~
eye margin, inner orbit for the frontal or facial margin, and outer orbit for the genal margin. The ~
genal area is the region behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge [Figs. 3 and 4]. The v
ridge surrounding the concave posterior surface of the head above and laterally is called the",NA,NA,NA,NA

MOUTHPARTS (Figs. 5-9)
~ Bee mouthparts consist of paired mandibles

names of mandibular structures [Fig. 5], we usually
~ follow Michener and Fraser (1978). For simplicity

7 margin instead of teeth of the pollex. Other terms used herein are the condylar ridge, which
arises near the mandibular condyle and extends toward the apex of the mandible, and the outer
~ ridge, which is the next ridge above the condylar ridge on the outer surface of the mandible.",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"~ The bee proboscis is a complex structure formed from a fusion of the maxilla and labium,
we which together make up the “labiomaxillary complex.” The maxilla consists of paired cardines
(singular: cardo) that suspend the labiomaxillary complex from beneath the head capsule, the
~ stipes, blade-like galea (plural: galeae), and the maxillary palpus (plural: palpi) with up to six
~ segments [Figs. 6, 7]. Attached at the apex of the
hs cardines is the labium, which consists of the lorum,
e mentum, prementum, tongue-like glossa, and (typically)
four-segmented labial palpus [Fig. 6]. In Colletidae the
~ glossa is quite different from that of other bees [Fig. 8,
~ 9]. Rather than being slender and elongate, as in most
ka other bee families, the colletid glossa is short and",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"bilobed (sometimes referred to as “bifid”). This
~ modification of the glossa is related to the application of
a the thick, cellophane brood cell lining that characterizes
~ colletid bees (Batra 1980).
Bees can be divided into two broad categories
~ based on mouthpart morphology: short-tongued bees
~ (Andrenidae, Halictidae, Colletidae, Stenotritidae, and
~ Melittidae), in which the labial palpal segments are all
v similar in morphology (Fig. 8), and long-tongued bees
(Apidae and Megachilidae), in which the first two labial
~ palpal segments are slender and blade-like (Fig. 6).
~ Danforth et al. (2019) provide a more detailed
_ description of the proboscis and how it functions.
The proboscis is typically folded beneath the
~ head capsule, making it very difficult to distinguish",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,3,Text,"~ among the complex and interconnected elements.
~ However, if the mouthparts are pulled before pinning, while the specimen is still flexible, the
o individual elements can be easily recognized. In some cases, it is necessary to examine the
maxillary and labial palpi and to count the number of palpal segments (e.g., in certain Eucerini).
~ It can also be useful to be able to identify the blade-like, first two labial palpal segments in long-",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"tongued bees as a tool for knowing whether you are examining a short-tongued or long-tongued
bee. But this is by no means essential for using the keys to the genera. Chapter 11 (Key to the ~
Families of North and Central America), however, makes heavy use of mouthpart characters ~
because these characters are defining features of the bee families. sl
MESOSOMA (Figs. 11-18) ~
The mesosoma is a compact structure consisting of sclerites of the pro-, meso- and ~
metathoracic segments, which bear the legs and wings, and the first true abdominal segment, WJ
termed the propodeum [Figs. 13 and 14]. The prothorax in bees is represented primarily by the
large pronotum, which extends laterally and meets ventrally behind the forecoxae, forming a ~",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"tubelike structure. The pronotal lobe is a useful landmark, and its shape and location may be used ~
in generic identification. The mesothorax and metathorax bear the wings and the second and is
third pairs of legs. In dorsal view [Fig. 14], the mesothorax can be divided into four distinct
sclerites: the scutum, the scutellum, and paired axillae. Dorsally, the metathorax consists of a ~
single sclerite, the metanotum. Laterally [Fig. 13], the mesothorax is represented by the ~
mesepisternum, sometimes referred to as the mesopleuron. The mesepisternum is sometimes ~
divided by the pre-episternal groove into the pre-episternum (or pre-episternal area) and the rest
of the mesepisternum. The shape and location of the pre-episternal groove, the scrobal groove, ~",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"and the scrobe are often important in generic identification. The metepisternum (or metapleuron) ~
forms the lateral surface of the metathorax. The wing bases are located above the upper margins ~
of the mesepisternum and the metepisternum. Js
<a
~
The form and subdivisions of the propodeum are not easy to illustrate but are exceedingly ~
important for identification. Many bees have a pair of impressed lines on the propodeum, Ww
beginning near the anterior dorsolateral parts of the propodeum and extending downward and
posteromesially and nearly meeting in the propodeal pit [Fig. 149], a median depression of the ~
lower posterior surface. These lines, together with the anterior dorsal margin of the propodeum, ~",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,4,Text,"enclose the triangular area, or propodeal triangle [Fig. 149]. Morphologically, this triangle is the ww
metapostnotum (Brothers 1976). The shape of the propodeum as seen in profile is quite
independent of the triangle. The whole propodeum may be vertical or nearly so, dropping from ~
the posterior margin of the metanotum. In this case it is termed declivous. However, as in Fig. ~
13, there may be a more or less horizontal basal region. In Fig. 13 it is separated by a sharp line, ~",NA,NA,NA,NA
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,5,Text,"~ or carina, from the declivous posterior surface. When such is the case, the horizontal part is
~ called the basal zone, or basal area, of the propodeum [Fig. 13]. It is part of the propodeal
~ triangle. The term ""basal area"" is applicable even if no
es sharp line separates the horizontal from the vertical
surfaces. In some bees the two surfaces are continuously
~ rounded, one onto the other in a broad curving surface; in
~ that case the term “basal area” is not definable unless there
~ is distinctive surface sculpturing.",NA,NA,NA,NA

ww typical patterns of wing venation. Scarpulla (2018)
identified a number of such wing vein anomalies in
~ species of Colletidae, Andrenidae, Halictidae and
~ Apidae. These wing vein anomalies are commonly
~ expressed as a loss of the second transverse cubital vein
o in which a bee species that typically has three
submarginal cells instead has two. In some cases individuals can have normal wing venation on
~ one side of the body and non-typical wing venation on the other. If you suspect you have a

Many bees do not fall unequivocally into one of the above categories. Much of a ~
specimen's appearance depends on how full the crop was when the specimen was killed, how wy
much the metasoma has telescoped in drying, and so forth. Nonetheless, we think that these wy
terms may be useful to give an idea of the characteristic aspect of a genus.

Many groups of solitary bees are host-plant specialists (also referred to as “oligolectic”
bees), meaning they visit a small group of closely related host-plants for pollen. For these asl
specialist groups we list the likely host-plant genera and families upon which they specialize. For ~
“oil bees”, bees that collect floral oils for brood cell lining and pollen provisions, we also list the ww
floral hosts that serve as a source for the oils as well as morphological modifications associated
with oil collecting. ~
