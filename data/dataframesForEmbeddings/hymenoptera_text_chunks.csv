' Wings'

(Figs. 13-19)

The system used here for naming wing veins

y and cells is the Comstock and Needham
(1898-1899) system updated by Comstock (1918),
Ross (1936) and others (see Mason 1990 for
additional references). Unfortunately, there are

> other systems employed by hymenopterists such as
the Rohwer-Gahan (1916) system widely used for
the Ichneumonoidea. The authors of the chapters",NA,NA,NA,NA
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4,Text,"s on Apoidea, Chrysidoidea, and Vespoidea prefer a

a different system of naming wing cells. One reason

8, for this, given by Michener (p. 310 in this
publication), is that it is sometimes impossible to
determine the true origins of some wing cells. For
example, the three submarginal cells of most
aculeate Hymenoptera are 1R1, 1Rs, and 2Rs.
When the number is reduced to two, one cannot",NA,NA,NA,NA
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,4,Text,": determine whether the missing vein is the second
abscissa of Rs or Ir-m. Therefore, when naming
these cells, the use of the generic term submarginal
is more practical than the more specific terms 1R1,
1Rs and 2Rs. For comparison, the equivalent (when
the complete complement of three cells is present)
names of veins and cells used in the Comstock-
Needham system are tabulated in Chapter 7",NA,NA,NA,NA
