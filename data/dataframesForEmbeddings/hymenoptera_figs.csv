It illustrates two different head structures: one representing a hypognathous head and the other a prognathous head, likely in an anatomical context related to insects, particularly their facial features. The diagrams provide a visual comparison of these head structures alongside descriptive text."

The diagram includes arrows pointing to specific features called toruli, indicating their relationship to the frontal carina. This appears to relate to anatomical or biological terminology."

It shows a paired socket on the front of an insect's head where the scape, a part of the antenna, is articulated. The arrows point to specific features on the illustration, indicating the location of the toruli. This type of anatomical illustration is often used in entomology to describe insect head morphology."
