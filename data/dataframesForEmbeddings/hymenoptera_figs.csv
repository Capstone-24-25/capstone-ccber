It shows a simplified anatomical representation, likely focusing on specific features between the frontal area and toruli, with arrows indicating areas of interest. The accompanying text describes the frontal carina as a longitudinal ridge or pair of ridges located on the frons."

The illustration shows two head profiles, likely pertaining to insects, highlighting different aspects of the gena in various head orientations (hypognathous and prognathous). The accompanying description elaborates on its location and function."

The illustration shows the toruli with arrows pointing to them, indicating their location, and includes labeled anatomical features of the head."
