MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"~ Chapter 4 — A primer on bee morphology

v [updated 6/28/2022]

~ In order to use the keys in this book effectively, it is important to become familiar with

~ the morphology of bees and the terms used to describe morphological features. With that goal in

iJ mind, we present below an overview of bee morphology and an introduction to the terms that are
used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based

~ on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener’s PhD thesis (Michener 1944).

~ Additional key papers on bee morphology include Urban (1967), Camargo et al. (1967),",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"wv Eickwort (1969), Stephen et al. (1969), and Brooks (1988). The illustrations in this chapter are
redrawn from Michener (1944 and 1965a) and Danforth (1996). For a detailed look at the

~ internal and external anatomy of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), see Snodgrass (1956). For a

~ comprehensive and modern overview of general insect morphology, see Beutel et al. (2014).

¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"~ mouthparts. However, in most Hymenoptera (bees included), the thorax and abdomen have been

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.

9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1.0,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

~ For use of the keys, it will be important to identify specific metasomal terga or sterna. To do so,",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2.0,Text,"we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the

first metasoma tergum is T1, the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first ~
metasomal sternum is S1, the second S2, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are ~
comfortable with identifying specific metasomal terga and sterna when you start using the keys. wi",,,,

The figure provides a detailed illustration of the malar area, which is defined as the space between the eye and the mandible. The malar area's significance lies in its use for taxonomic differentiation, as its length is measured as the shortest distance from the eye to the base of the mandible. Additionally, the figure highlights the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are depicted as shallow depressions and are typically black in color, serving as critical identifiers for species classification. This visual representation aids in understanding the spatial relationships and morphological characteristics critical for scientific and educational purposes in entomology."

The preoccipital ridge itself is depicted as a prominent structure encircling the posterior part of the head, characterized by its concavity and sometimes featuring a preoccipital carina, which is a ridge found on the preoccipital ridge. Additionally, the figure includes a depiction of the proboscidial fossa, a significant groove on the underside of the head where the proboscis retracts. This visual representation is crucial for understanding the spatial relationships and morphological details of these components, which are essential for studies related to bee anatomy and physiology. The clear labeling and distinct illustration of each part make this figure a valuable resource for researchers focusing on entomological and anatomical studies of bees."

The figure is divided into several panels, each illustrating a different stage in the early life of a bee. Panel 4-1a depicts the elongate and gently curved eggs, which are whitish and have a soft, membranous chorion. These eggs are typically laid on or within the food mass intended for larval consumption. This setup is crucial for the initial nourishment of the larvae upon hatching.

Panels 4-1b through 4-1d sequentially illustrate the progression of the larval stage, showing the transformation from newly hatched larvae to more developed forms. These larvae are depicted as soft, whitish, legless grubs. The figure highlights how these larvae typically lie on the upper surface of the food mass, consuming the food below and in front of them. This feeding strategy supports their rapid growth and multiple moltings, which are essential processes in their development towards pupation.

Overall, Fig. 4-1 effectively encapsulates the critical early developmental stages of bees, emphasizing the morphological changes and feeding behaviors that are pivotal for their growth and survival.
