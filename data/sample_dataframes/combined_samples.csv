= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.",,,,

The figure provides a detailed illustration of the malar area, which is defined as the space between the eye and the mandible. The malar area's significance lies in its use for taxonomic differentiation, as its length is measured as the shortest distance from the eye to the base of the mandible. Additionally, the figure highlights the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are depicted as shallow depressions and are typically black in color, serving as critical identifiers for species classification. This visual representation aids in understanding the spatial relationships and morphological characteristics critical for scientific and educational purposes in entomology."

This figure provides a detailed illustration of the bee's head highlighting the genal area, which is located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. The preoccipital ridge itself is depicted as a prominent structure encircling the posterior part of the head, characterized by its concavity and sometimes featuring a preoccipital carina, which is a ridge found on the preoccipital ridge. Additionally, the figure includes a depiction of the proboscidial fossa, a significant groove on the underside of the head where the proboscis retracts. This visual representation is crucial for understanding the spatial relationships and morphological details of these components, which are essential for studies related to bee anatomy and physiology. The clear labeling and distinct illustration of each part make this figure a valuable resource for researchers focusing on entomological and anatomical studies of bees."
