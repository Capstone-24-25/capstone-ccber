Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,1,Text,"This guide is intended to familiarize the reader
with the families of Hymenoptera, not hymen-
opteran morphology. We therefore attempt to use
the simplest acceptable terms for structures. Terms Gi
used in the keys are defined and illustrated in the
glossary. A brief overview of hymenopteran
morphology, accompanied by labeled drawings of
bodies and wings representing some major groups",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,1,Text,"of Hymenoptera, is given to orient the reader and .
put into perspective many of the terms used. Gi",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,1,Text,"When the reader goes beyond this guide to
identify specimens to the level of genus or species, a
plethora of other, often synonymous, morphological
terms will be encountered. In part, this occurs
because over many years various terms have been
replaced by more exact or more generalized terms
and different terms have been applied to
homologous structures in various groups.",,,,
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,Charles D. Michener,HOTWPublisher,1,Text,"Consequently, any given structure may have several He

names applied to it, and one term may apply to

several distinct structures. This confusion is

nowhere more apparent than in names applied to

the wing veins, where several major systems are

used.",,,,
