used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based

~ on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener’s PhD thesis (Michener 1944).

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.",,,,
