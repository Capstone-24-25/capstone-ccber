MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"~ Chapter 4 — A primer on bee morphology

v [updated 6/28/2022]

~ In order to use the keys in this book effectively, it is important to become familiar with

~ the morphology of bees and the terms used to describe morphological features. With that goal in

iJ mind, we present below an overview of bee morphology and an introduction to the terms that are
used throughout the keys. We follow the terminology used in Michener (2007), which is based

~ on morphological studies of bees that date back to Michener’s PhD thesis (Michener 1944).

~ Additional key papers on bee morphology include Urban (1967), Camargo et al. (1967),",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"wv Eickwort (1969), Stephen et al. (1969), and Brooks (1988). The illustrations in this chapter are
redrawn from Michener (1944 and 1965a) and Danforth (1996). For a detailed look at the

~ internal and external anatomy of the honeybee (Apis mellifera), see Snodgrass (1956). For a

~ comprehensive and modern overview of general insect morphology, see Beutel et al. (2014).

¥ BODY REGIONS

= Before diving into the details, let’s consider a basic question. What do we call the three

~ body regions in bees? For most insects, the body is divided into three distinct regions: head,

iy thorax, and abdomen. The abdomen houses the reproductive, digestive, and excretory organs.
The thorax houses the leg and flight muscles, and the head bears the sensory organs and",,,,

ad reconfigured to such an extent that we cannot use these same terms. In Apocrita (= Hymenoptera

- with a narrow waist), the first abdominal segment has become attached to the posterior region of
the thorax and the narrow “waist” is actually a constriction between abdominal segments | and 2.

9 Therefore, in Apocrita, we need to use slightly different terms. In Apocrita we refer to the
“mesosoma” (= thorax plus first abdominal segment, or “propodeum”; Fig. 13) and “metasoma”

~ (= remaining abdominal segments). Thus, in bees, we refer to the three body regions as head,

~ mesosoma, and metasoma. The head and mesosoma are complex structures and we will cover",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,1,Text,"= those below. The metasoma, by contrast, is fairly simple consisting of dorsal sclerites (terga)
paired with ventral sclerites (sterna) to form a tube enclosing the internal organs plus genitalia.

~ For use of the keys, it will be important to identify specific metasomal terga or sterna. To do so,",,,,
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,2,Text,"we number terga and sterna of the metasoma starting with metasomal segment 1. Therefore, the

first metasoma tergum is T1, the second T2, and so forth. The same is true for sterna: the first ~
metasomal sternum is S1, the second S2, and so forth [Fig. 19]. Make sure that you are ~
comfortable with identifying specific metasomal terga and sterna when you start using the keys. wi",,,,
