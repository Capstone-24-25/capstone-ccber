MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,15,Image,,2,MMD-Figures/page_15_img_2.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_15_img_2.png,"Fig. 2 in the manuscript by John I Huber, published in MMD, focuses on the anatomical features of the head capsule in a specified insect species. The figure provides a detailed illustration of the malar area, which is defined as the space between the eye and the mandible. The malar area's significance lies in its use for taxonomic differentiation, as its length is measured as the shortest distance from the eye to the base of the mandible. Additionally, the figure highlights the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are depicted as shallow depressions and are typically black in color, serving as critical identifiers for species classification. This visual representation aids in understanding the spatial relationships and morphological characteristics critical for scientific and educational purposes in entomology."
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,15,Image,,3,MMD-Figures/page_15_img_3.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_15_img_3.png,"Figure 3 from the manuscript by John I Huber in the journal MMD focuses on the anatomical features of the bee's head, particularly the genal area and the preoccipital ridge. This figure provides a detailed illustration of the bee's head highlighting the genal area, which is located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. The preoccipital ridge itself is depicted as a prominent structure encircling the posterior part of the head, characterized by its concavity and sometimes featuring a preoccipital carina, which is a ridge found on the preoccipital ridge. Additionally, the figure includes a depiction of the proboscidial fossa, a significant groove on the underside of the head where the proboscis retracts. This visual representation is crucial for understanding the spatial relationships and morphological details of these components, which are essential for studies related to bee anatomy and physiology. The clear labeling and distinct illustration of each part make this figure a valuable resource for researchers focusing on entomological and anatomical studies of bees."
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,16,Image,,4,MMD-Figures/page_16_img_4.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_16_img_4.png,"Figure 4, sourced from MMD and authored by John I Huber, focuses on the anatomical details of the malar area in an insect head capsule. This figure is pivotal for understanding the spatial relationship between the eye and the mandible of the insect, highlighting the shortest distance from the eye to the mandible and the width of the base of the mandible. Additionally, it illustrates the genal area, which is located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. The figure effectively delineates the boundaries and features of these areas, crucial for studies in entomology related to insect head morphology. The clear labeling and detailed depiction serve as a valuable reference for identifying and comparing these anatomical features across different insect species."
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,16,Image,,5,MMD-Figures/page_16_img_5.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_16_img_5.png,"Fig. 5, sourced from MMD and authored by John I Huber, illustrates the detailed anatomy of bee mandibles, focusing on their structural components as per the naming conventions of Michener and Fraser (1978). This figure is central to understanding the functional morphology of bee mouthparts, specifically highlighting the mandibles used for chewing. Key labeled components include the preapical teeth and various other mandibular structures, each annotated clearly to show their relative positions and interactions. These components are crucial for the bees' ability to process food materials, playing a significant role in their feeding mechanism which involves both lapping and sucking nectar. The diagram serves as an essential reference for entomologists and researchers studying hymenopteran mouthpart mechanics and their evolutionary adaptations."
MMD,2022,"Danforth, Bryan, et al.",MMDPublisher,16,Image,,6,MMD-Figures/page_16_img_6.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/MMD-Figures/page_16_img_6.png,"Fig. 6, sourced from MMD and authored by John I. Huber, illustrates the specialized structure of bee mouthparts, focusing particularly on the labial palpus. This figure is essential for understanding the morphological differences in the labial palpus among various bee families. It specifically highlights the first two segments of the labial palpus, which are depicted as elongated, flattened, and sheath-like, contrasting sharply with the shorter, more typical last two segments. This configuration is significant as it demonstrates adaptation in the feeding mechanism of bees, supporting efficient nectar and pollen collection. The detailed labeling and differentiation in the figure provide a clear visual comparison, aiding in the identification and study of bee species based on mouthpart morphology. This figure is a key reference for entomologists and researchers studying the functional anatomy and evolutionary biology of bees."
