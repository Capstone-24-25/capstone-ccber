BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,23,Image,,7-2,BOTW-Figures/page_23_img_7-2.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_23_img_7-2.png,"Figure 7-2 from ""Bees of the World"" by Daniel C. Danforth illustrates the underground nest structures of the eucerine bee, Peponapis fervens, in Brazil. The figure presents a mature nest alongside newer nests, showcasing variations in nest architecture. The mature nest is depicted with obscured lateral burrows filled with earth, indicating the nest's evolutionary adaptation to protect its structure and contents. In contrast, the newer nests each feature a single, clearly visible lateral burrow, which is newly constructed and unprovisioned. This comparison highlights the developmental stages of the nest and the bee's method of expanding and securing its reproductive site. The diagram serves as a visual explanation of the nesting behavior of Peponapis fervens, emphasizing the strategic placement and construction of lateral burrows to optimize survival and reproduction."

Danforth illustrates the nesting structure of the colonial halictine bee, Halictus ligatus Say, as excavated in soil in Trinidad. This diagram specifically focuses on the arrangement of sessile cells within the nest. The figure effectively shows the spatial layout and developmental stages of the bee larvae within these cells. Key labeled components include cells marked with dots, which represent abandoned, earth-filled cells. Other cells are labeled to indicate their contents: 'e' for empty, 'E' for egg, 'SL' for small larva, 'ML' for medium-sized larva, and 'PP' for a large larva, usually in the prepupal stage. This detailed labeling helps in understanding the life cycle stages and nest occupancy, providing insights into the reproductive and developmental biology of Halictus ligatus. The diagram serves as a valuable visual aid for comprehending the complex life processes and nest architecture of this bee species."

Danforth illustrates the nests of Augochlorella striata (Provancher) excavated into soil. The figure features two main components: at the left, a cluster of cells exposed by digging, and at the center, a detailed view of a single nest. These components highlight the construction techniques of Augochlorella striata, showcasing the smooth earthen layers lining the cells and the application of a waxlike material. This figure effectively demonstrates the natural engineering skills of these bees, emphasizing their ability to modify and utilize soil materials to create protective environments for their offspring. The visual representation aids in understanding the text's discussion on the nesting behavior of soil-excavating bees and refutes earlier views that such sophisticated construction does not occur."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,26,Image,,7-6,BOTW-Figures/page_26_img_7-6.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_26_img_7-6.png,"Figure 7-6 from ""Bees of the World"" by Daniel C. Danforth illustrates the nesting behavior of Heriades spiniscutis (Cameron) in dead, dry stems. This figure provides a visual comparison of three different nests, highlighting variations in construction techniques within the species. One nest, located on the right side of the figure, features thin partitions made of pith fragments between the cells, which are indicated by horizontal lines. The other two nests depicted do not have any partitions between the cells. This figure effectively demonstrates the variability in cell partitioning in Megachilidae bee nests, specifically showing how Heriades spiniscutis may or may not use partitions, which are crucial for understanding nesting ecology and behavior in this species. The figure underscores the adaptability and resource utilization of these bees in their natural habitat."
BOTW,2007,BOTWAuthor.,BOTWPublisher,34,Image,,8-1,BOTW-Figures/page_34_img_8-1.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BOTW-Figures/page_34_img_8-1.png,"Figure 8-1 from ""Bees of the World"" by Daniel C. Danforth illustrates the proboscidial structures of parasitic and nonparasitic allodapine bees, focusing on the maxilla and labium. This figure compares the anatomical features of two parasitic species, Eucondylops reducta Michener and Nasutapis straussorum Michener (labeled as a and b), with those of a nonparasitic species, Allodapula melanopus (Cameron), labeled as c. The key components highlighted are the maxilla (left side of each pair) and the labium (right side of each pair), which are essential for feeding behaviors in bees. The illustration is scaled uniformly across all species to emphasize the morphological differences, particularly showing the reduction in size of these structures in the parasitic species compared to the nonparasitic species. This visual comparison underscores evolutionary adaptations linked to the bees' parasitic or nonparasitic lifestyles."
