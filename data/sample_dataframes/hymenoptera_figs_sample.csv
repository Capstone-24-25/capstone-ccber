Hymenoptera of the World,1993,John I Huber,HOTWPublisher,19,Image,,1,HOTW-Figures/pg_19_img_1.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/HOTW-Figures/pg_19_img_1.png,"Fig. 1 from ""Hymenoptera of the World"" (1993) by Charles D. Michener illustrates the terms of relative position used in entomological keys. The figure is divided into two main sections: the first depicts a winged insect's lateral view, while the second presents a top-down perspective of a circular structure.

Key labeled components include ""anterior,"" ""posterior,"" ""medial,"" and ""lateral,"" indicating directional terminology essential for identifying anatomical features in Hymenoptera. The terms ""anterior margin"" and ""posterior margin"" highlight the specific edges of anatomical structures, aiding in precise classification. The circular diagram's labels such as ""dorsal,"" ""ventral,"" and ""apex"" provide additional spatial references critical for understanding insect morphology.

This figure serves as a foundational reference for researchers and students, emphasizing the importance of accurate terminology in the study of insect anatomy and taxonomy."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species from the genus Symphyta, specifically *Aglaostigma quattuordecimpunctatum* (Norton). This dorsal view highlights key components essential for understanding insect morphology. The figure labels include the **scape**, crucial for antenna support; **mesoscutum**, which is part of the thorax; and **metascutum**, contributing to the structural integrity of the back. Other notable features are the **ocellus** and **eye** on the head, which are vital for sensory perception. The **ovipositor sheath** and **cercus** are labeled to demonstrate their importance in reproductive processes. Each labeled component plays a significant role in the insect's anatomy, providing insight into its functionality and adaptation. The clear delineation of these parts serves as a reference for comparative morphology and taxonomic classification within Hymenoptera."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species of Symphyta, *Aglossigma quattordecimpunctatum* (Norton) in a lateral view. The labeled components provide a comprehensive overview of the anatomical features critical for identification and understanding of the species. Key components include the head, noted for structures such as the ocellus and eye, which are vital for sensory functions. The thorax is further delineated into areas like the propleuron and mesocotum, each important for locomotion mechanics. The abdomen showcases notable structures such as the ovipositor sheath and terga, which are essential for reproductive functions and egg-laying. The detailed labeling facilitates an in-depth study of morphological characteristics relevant to entomological research and species differentiation within the Hymenoptera order."
Hymenoptera of the World,1993,John I Huber,HOTWPublisher,22,Image,,4,HOTW-Figures/pg_22_img_4.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/HOTW-Figures/pg_22_img_4.png,"Figure 4, sourced from ""Hymenoptera of the World"" (1993) by Charles D. Michener, illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species of Apocrita, specifically Nomada sp. The figure is a dorsal view, depicting essential anatomical components important for understanding Hymenopteran morphology. 

Key labeled components include the **head**, featuring the **scape**, **ocellus**, **eye**, and **pronotum**, crucial for sensory functions and head structure. The **mesosoma** is highlighted with elements such as the **mesoscutum**, **tegula**, **axilla**, **scutellum**, and **metanotum**, which are vital for flight mechanics and support. The **metasoma** section includes the **propodeum**, **metacoxa**, and distinct segments (1-5), significant for reproductive and locomotor functions. The **cercus**, alongside the **ovipositor (sting)**, plays an important role in oviposition and defense. This comprehensive visualization is critical for entomological studies and identification of Hymenoptera species."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species from the genus Apocrita, specifically Nomada sp. The figure provides a lateral view of the specimen, highlighting key anatomical features essential for understanding Hymenoptera morphology. 

Key labeled components include the **head**, which contains the **scape**, **ocellus**, and **eye**, indicating sensory functions; the **mesosome**, with structures like the **mesoscutum** and **tegula**, crucial for wing attachment and movement; and the **metasoma**, highlighted by the **ovipositor (sting)**, which is vital for reproductive functions. Additional labels, including **sternum** and **tergum**, denote significant body segments allowing for comparative analysis among species. Each component is integral to the overall anatomy, providing insights into the ecological adaptations and evolutionary relationships within the Apocrita group."
