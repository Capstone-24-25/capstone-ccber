Hymenoptera of the World,1993,John I Huber,HOTWPublisher,19,Image,,1,HOTW-Figures/pg_19_img_1.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/HOTW-Figures/pg_19_img_1.png,"**Figure 1** from *Hymenoptera of the World (1993)* by Charles D. Michener illustrates terms of relative position used in the description of insect morphology, specifically focusing on the structural orientation of wings and body parts. 

Key labeled components include:

- **Anterior, Posterior, and Lateral**: These terms define the directional orientation of body parts; anterior refers to the front, posterior to the back, and lateral to the sides, essential for accurate morphological descriptions.
- **Medial, Submedial, and Sublateral**: Indicate positions relative to the body's midline, aiding in the taxonomy and identification of species.
- **Dorsal and Ventral**: Highlight the upper and lower sides of the insect, crucial in understanding body structure in various insect orders.
- **Height, Width, and Length**: Measurements that provide a quantitative basis for anatomical classification.

This figure serves as a foundational reference that enhances clarity and precision in the study of Hymenoptera morphology."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species of Symphyta, Aglosaxigma quatuordecimpunctatum (Norton) from a dorsal perspective. The figure is divided into key labeled components: 

1. **Scape** - the long basal segment of the antenna.
2. **Mesoscutum** - the central dorsal area of the thorax, critical for wing attachment.
3. **Tegula** - small, plate-like structures aiding in wing movement.
4. **Notalulus** - a groove indicating the separation of thoracic segments.
5. **Cenchrus** - an accessory structure that may assist in locomotion.
6. **Metascutum** - the posterior part of the thorax, important for structural integrity.
7. **Abdominal Segments** (1-10) - each segment plays distinct roles in reproduction and movement.
8. **Cercus** - sensory appendages at the rear, aiding in environmental navigation.
9. **Ovipositor Sheath** - necessary for egg-laying, critical for species reproduction.

This detailed diagram enhances understanding of Hymenoptera anatomy and its ecological adaptations."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species of Symphyta, specifically *Aglaostigma quattordecimpunctatum* (Norton), in a lateral view. The figure is divided into three main sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen, each labeled with critical anatomical components. 

Key features include the scape and ocellus in the head, which are essential for sensory perception, and the mesopleuron and metapleuron in the thorax, which play significant roles in locomotion. The abdomen features important structures such as the terga (segments 1 to 10) and the ovipositor sheath, contributing to reproductive processes. The coxae (procxa, mesocoxa, metacoxa) are emphasized for their function in appendage articulation. This figure serves as a vital reference for understanding the intricate anatomy of this Hymenoptera species."

Michener illustrates the primary morphological divisions and structures of a species within the genus Apocrita, specifically *Nomada sp.* This dorsal view highlights key anatomical components critical for identification and classification within the Hymenoptera order.

The labeled sections include the **head**, featuring the **scape**, **occellus**, and **eye**, which are significant for sensory functions. The **mesosoma** comprises structures like the **mesoscutum**, **tegula**, and **scutellum**, playing essential roles in locomotion and wing attachment. The **metasoma** encompasses the **metacoxa** and structures 1 through 5, culminating in the **ovipositor** (sting), a crucial feature for reproduction. The **cercus** is also noted, contributing to various behaviors in this insect. This comprehensive diagram serves as a valuable reference for entomologists studying Hymenoptera morphology."

Michener illustrates the main morphological divisions and structures of a species of Apocrita, *Nomada sp.* (Anthophoridae), depicted in a lateral view. The figure is divided into three primary sections: the head, mesosoma, and metasoma. 

Key labeled components include the head featuring critical sensory structures such as the scape, ocellus, and eye, which are vital for navigation and environmental interaction. The mesosoma displays important segments including the propleuron, pronotum, and metanotum, each contributing to locomotion and flight capabilities. The metasoma is highlighted by the sternum, tergum, and ovipositor; the latter is essential for reproduction. 

The detailed labeling of these components underscores the complexity of insect anatomy and provides insights into the functional adaptations of this species, crucial for studies in entomology and ecology."
