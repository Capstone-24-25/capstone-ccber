The arrows point to the specific area of the frontal carina, between the toruli (which are small, often sensory organs). The diagram serves as a biological reference for understanding the structure in question."

The accompanying drawings show two different head shapes, likely illustrating the concept of hypognathous and prognathous heads, highlighting the anatomical features being described."
Hymenoptera-Figures/,Image,NA,3,Hymenoptera-Figures/hymenoptera_img_3.png,https://ccber-tester-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Hymenoptera-Figures/hymenoptera_img_3.png,"The image shows a diagram of a concept referred to as ""torulus,"" which is defined as a paired socket located on the front of the head where the scape, a part of an insect's antenna, is articulated. The diagram illustrates this concept, highlighting the toruli (sockets) with arrows pointing to them, along with a basic outline of a head structure. The accompanying text provides a definition of the term."
