Characteristics to Males of the Anthidiine Gen-era of the Eastern Hemisphere(From Griswold and Michener, 1994a)The preceding key will be frustrating for various reasons,chief among which will likely be that couplet 1 is basedlargely on a character of females; supplementary charac-ters will help, but as indicated within the couplet, they arenot always decisive. The following supplementary key formales leads either to certain genera or to numbered cou-plets in the main key, thus bypassing couplet 1.
