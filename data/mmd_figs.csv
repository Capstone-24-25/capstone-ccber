Fig. 2 focuses on the anatomical features of the insect head capsule, specifically highlighting the malar area and the foveae. The malar area, as depicted, is defined as the space between the eye and the mandible of the insect. This figure measures the malar area by the shortest distance from the lower edge of the eye to the base of the mandible, emphasizing its relevance in morphological studies. Additionally, the figure illustrates the foveae on the face and the sides of the second metasomal tergum (T2). These foveae are shown as shallow depressions, typically black in color, which are significant for sensory functions in insects. The clear labeling and focused depiction in Fig. 2 provide a detailed view of these key anatomical structures, aiding in the understanding of insect head morphology and its functional adaptations."

Fig. 3 illustrates the detailed anatomy of the bee's head, specifically focusing on the genal area and the preoccipital region. The genal area, located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge, is depicted with clarity, highlighting its proximity to other key structures. The preoccipital ridge, a significant anatomical feature, encircles the concave posterior surface of the head both above and laterally. This ridge is further defined by the presence of the preoccipital carina, a ridge-like structure that may be present on the preoccipital ridge, adding to the complexity of the bee's head anatomy.

Additionally, the figure prominently features the proboscidial fossa, a large, deep groove on the underside of the head. This structure is crucial as it serves as the folding area for the proboscis, an essential part of the bee's feeding mechanism.

This figure serves as an educational tool, providing a clear visual representation of these critical anatomical features, which are vital for understanding the morphology and function of the bee's head. The labeling is precise, aiding in the identification and differentiation of the structures, making it a valuable resource for entomologists and students studying insect anatomy."

Figure 4 provides a detailed illustration of the insect head capsule, focusing on the malar and genal areas. The malar area, prominently labeled, is defined as the shortest distance between the eye and the mandible, highlighting its significance in the structural anatomy of the insect head. This area is crucial for understanding the feeding mechanics and articulation of the mandible relative to the eye. Adjacent to this, the genal area is depicted as the region located behind the eye and in front of the preoccipital ridge. This area is essential for studies related to the sensory reception and protection mechanisms of the insect, given its proximity to major sensory organs. The figure is meticulously labeled to emphasize these key anatomical features, providing a clear visual reference for entomological studies focusing on head morphology and function. This detailed depiction aids in the identification and comparative analysis of these critical regions across different insect species."

Figure 5 provides a detailed illustration of the mandibular structures of a bee, highlighting the anatomical features used for chewing. This figure is essential for understanding the functional morphology of bee mouthparts, particularly the mandibles. The key components labeled in the figure include the preapical teeth and various other structural landmarks that are critical for the mandible's mechanical function during feeding and manipulation of materials. Each labeled part is clearly identified, showing the intricate details and arrangement that enable the mandibles to effectively perform their roles. This figure serves as a visual reference for the names and positions of these structures as classified by Michener and Fraser (1978), offering a clear and concise depiction for educational and research purposes in entomology and related fields."
