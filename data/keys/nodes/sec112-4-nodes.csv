sec112-4-3,"Maxillary palpus threeto four-segmented or with minute ﬁfth segment, often not longer than maximum width of galeal blade; keirotrichiate area of female apically at least half as wide as hind tibia and extending basad beyond middle of tibia; scopa consisting of sparse, strongly plumose hairs on outer surface of tibia, each arising from tubercle separated from its neighbors by full width of tubercle",T etralonia,"Maxillary palpus ﬁveor six-segmented, often longer than maximum width of galeal blade; keirotrichiate area and associated ﬁnely and closely punctate surface of female usually less than half as wide as hind tibia and extending basad only to middle of tibia, rarely absent; scopa consisting of denser hairs, often simple, if plumose, then arising from tubercles less widely separated from one another",sec112-4-4,T etralonia,,sec112-4-1

sec112-4-5,"S6 of male with the two converging carinae each usually angulate near anterior end, forming lateral angle usually reﬂecting marginal sternal angle or lobe (Fig. 11210e), which is often strengthened by lateral branch carina arising at angle of converging carina, sometimes carinae absent except for branch and mesally directed anterior end of converging carina, together forming transverse carina directed anteromesally from marginal sternal angle or lobe; clypeus usually protuberant for width of eye or more as seen in lateral view; blade of galea 1.2 or more times length of eye; middle femur of male on undersurface commonly with area of dense, appressed, red-brown hair hiding surface",Eucera (Synhalonia),"S6 of male with the two converging carinae each usually simple and more or less straight; clypeus usually protuberant for less than width of eye as seen in lateral view; blade of galea usually not much longer than length of eye; middle femur of male sometimes with area of sparse, appressed whitish hair not hiding surface, more commonly with unspecialized sloping or erect hair",T etraloniella,Eucera (Synhalonia),T etraloniella,sec112-4-4
