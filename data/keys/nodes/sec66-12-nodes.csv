sec66-12-1,"Posterior tibia of female with fringe of long, pectinate to palmate hairs along basal two-thirds of lower margin, these hairs not curved strongly posteriorly toward apex of tibia or upward across outer surface of tibia, but if pectinate, then branches close together (thus approaching palmate) and tending to be at right angles to rachis; intermediates between large hairs of lower tibial margin and hairs of outer tibial surface very few; metasomal terga frequently with basal areas of pale tomentum, without strong apical hair bands (except in Lomatalictus)",sec66-12-2,"Posterior tibia of female with long hairs of lower margin strongly curved posteriorly toward apex of tibia, or distal parts usually curved upward across outer surface of tibia, with well-separated long branches directed in same general direction as rachis, or usually branched in such a way that the rachis is not identiﬁable except basally; distal parts of long marginal hairs overlapping hairs of outer tibial surface, and intermediate hair types seemingly present, thus there is no striking superﬁcial contrast between long hairs of lower margin and hairs of outer surface (this is as in Lasioglossumand Halictus); metasomal terga without basal bands or lateral areas of tomentum, frequently with apical bands of pale hairs",sec66-12-6,,,

sec66-12-4,"Scutum and scutellum smooth or minutely roughened to coarsely striate, with punctures well separated at least in some areas; metasomal terga without areas of pale tomentum (ignoring pale hairs arising from graduli); S4 of male similar in size and shape to S3 and S5, without very large bristles (Madagascar)",P . (Archihalictus),"Scutum and scutellum coarsely and closely punctate or punctures usually so large that surface is coarsely reticulate, rarely, as in Pachyhalictus (Pachyhalictus) binghami (Kirby), with partly smooth areas; metasomal terga (at least T2 and T3) with basal areas of pale tomentum, sometimes expanded to cover whole terga; S4 of male short, largely hidden, with a few large apical or preapical bristles",sec66-12-5,P .

sec66-12-5,"Inner hind tibial spur of female pectinate with three to six long teeth; basitibial plate of male absent or indicated only at apex; S4 of male not produced posteriorly at side but with an enormous and complex lateral bristle, usually hidden by T4 (Fig. 66-20c); ﬁrst two hind tarsal segments of male fused (Oriental to Australia)",P . (Pachyhalictus),"Inner hind tibial spur of female serrate or pectinate with ten or more teeth; basitibial plate of male present; S4 of male produced posteriorly at side with several large bristles usually hidden by T4; ﬁrst two hind tarsal segments of male apparently articulated, but articulation broader than that between subsequent tarsomeres (Africa)",P .
