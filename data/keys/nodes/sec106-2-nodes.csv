In addition to the characters indicated in the key to genera, it differs from Exomalopsis in having the areas between the ocelli and the eyes convex. The stigma is commonly smaller than in Exomalopsis, less than half as long as the length of the marginal cell on the wing margin, but this character is consistent only for the subgenus Anthophorula s. str. In Anthophorisca the stigma is often as large as in those Exo- malopsis having smaller stigmas, although never as large as those in some Exomalopsiss. str. The body length ranges from 2.5 to 8.0 mm; the smallest species are in the  subgenusAnthophorula s. str., but one species of An- thophorisca is only 3.5 mm long. Male genitalia and hid- den sterna were illustrated by Michener and Moure (1957), Mitchell (1962), Timberlake (1980b), and Sil- veira (1995a, b). As in Exomalopsis but not Eremapis, nests of Antho- phorula are usually communally occupied burrows, each being inhabited by several females (Rozen, 1984c). Cells are oval, with a thin waterproof lining. As in the genus Exomalopsis,the provision mass is partly lifted off the cell surface by a projection, called a “foot” by Rozen (1977b, 1984a); it presumably reduces the area of moist contact between the provision mass and the cell surface, and thus may reduce the danger of mold. In A. (Anthophorisca) sidae (Cockerell) and nitens (Cockerell), larvae of the au- tumn generation spin cocoons, but those of the summer generation do not (Rozen, 1984a; Rozen and Snelling, 1986), although they retain the cephalic structures char- acteristic of cocoon-spinning larvae.
