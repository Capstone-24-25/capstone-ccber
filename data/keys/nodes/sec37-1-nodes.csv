sec37-1-1,"Body usually hairy, female with well-formed scopa enclosing corbicula on underside of hind femur; prepygidial ﬁmbria (apical hair band of T5) of female much stronger (hairs longer and denser) than hair bands (if any) of preceding terga, and T6 with abundant hair (pygidial ﬁmbria) lateral to pygidial plate (except in genera that lack both ﬁmbriae and pygidial plate); pygidial plate of female, if present, usually broad and tapering posteriorly; forewing with three submarginal cells or, if two, then second at least two-thirds as long as ﬁrst, as though second submarginal crossvein is lost; distal submarginal crossvein sinuate, at acute angle to distal part of radial sector forming free part of marginal cell (Fig. 38-17)",sec37-1-2,"Body with hairs short and relatively sparse, female lacking scopa or with a sparse or short scopa forming corbicula on underside of hind femur; prepygidial and pygidial ﬁmbriae of female nearly always absent; pygidial plate of female absent or, if present, then usually narrow and parallel-sided posteriorly, or spinelike; forewing with two submarginal cells, second usually much shorter than ﬁrst, as though ﬁrst submarginal crossvein is lost; second submarginal crossvein usually not sinuate, usually at right or obtuse angle to distal part of radial sector (Fig. 47-2)",sec37-1-3,,,
sec37-1-2,"Stigma small, shorter than prestigma, as wide as prestigma measured to costal wing margin (Figs. 43-1, 44-1, 45-1); glossa deeply biﬁd with apical lobes commonly directed strongly apicolaterally (Western Hemisphere)",sec42-1,"Stigma usually large, at least longer than prestigma, usually wider than prestigma measured to wing margin (Figs. 39-2a, 39-5, 39-11, 41-1); glossa weakly bilobed to deeply biﬁd but, if the latter, then lobes commonly directed more apicad than laterally (except apicolaterally in Leioproctus tomentosusHouston from Western Australia)",sec38-1,Diphaglossinae,Colletinae,sec37-1-1
sec37-1-3,"Facial fovea absent or broad, at least one-third as wide as long; female with sparse scopa on S1 to S3 and outlining ventral corbicula on hind femur (Fig. 43-1); longitudinal part of hypostomal carina usually longer than clypeus but, if not, then clypeus protuberant and its lower lateral extremities bent back around ends of labrum (neotropical)",sec46-1,"Facial fovea usually a narrow groove, sometimes a broader area, wider than diameter of scape, absent in a few females and some males (Figs. 47-4, 47-6, 47-7); scopa absent; longitudinal part of hypostomal carina usually not longer than clypeus; clypeus usually not protuberant, not much bent back around ends of labrum",sec37-1-4,Xeromelissinae,,sec37-1-1
sec37-1-4,"Supraclypeal area elevated abruptly above level of antennal socket (Fig 47-3a); pygidial and basitibial plates usually absent but, if present (as in a few Australian and New Guinea species), then pygidial plate of female broad, its margins converging posteriorly; anterior surface of T1 usually without longitudinal median groove; posterior (lower) surface of prementum with longitudinal, usually spiculate depression or fovea (Fig. 41-3a) (weak in a few males) margined by ridges that diverge on basal half of prementum and meet near base of subligular process",sec47-1,"Supraclypeal area sloping up from level of antennal socket; apical part of pygidial plate of female slender, sometimes a spine, its margins parallel or converging slightly toward apex or spatulate; basitibial plate usually indicated in female, sometimes only by one or more tubercles; anterior surface of T1 with longitudinal median groove; posterior (lower) surface of prementum lacking longitudinal medial fovea but with comparable spiculate area (Australia)",sec48-1,Hylaeinae,Euryglossinae,sec37-1-3
