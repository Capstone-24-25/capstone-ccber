sec90-6-1,"Female with scopa reduced to mass of short, dense hairs; mandible of female with ventral tooth reduced to mere convexity so that mandible is bidentate; face concave; middle and hind tibial spurs robust, in female strongly curved apically, less than one-half as long as basitarsi; anterior margin of pronotum in both sexes with a sharp angle or small spine at level of base of fore coxa",E. (Inquilina),"Female with ordinary tibial scopa; mandible of female three-toothed (as in Fig. 90-9b); face not noticeably concave; middle and hind tibial spurs slender, in female gently curved, one-half as long as basitarsi or longer; anterior margin of pronotum with an inconspicuous rounded angle at level of base of fore coxa",sec90-6-2,E. (Inquilina),,
sec90-6-2,"Vein Cu1 of forewing usually long and gradually tapering (Fig. 90-11a, b); clypeus usually widely separated from antennal sockets, subantennal suture thus about as long as diameter of socket; fore tarsus of male attenuate, ﬁrst two segments taken together longer than tibia; hind basitarsus of male dilated (scarcely so in species such as E. asimillima Rayment), nearly as wide as tibia (except in E. asimillima), not parallel-sided",E. (Exoneura s. str.),"Vein Cu1 of forewing a short stub, ending abruptly (as in Fig. 90-11c), although in some cases continued as a pigmented line; clypeus usually closely approaching antennal sockets, subantennal suture thus much shorter than diameter of socket; fore tarsus of male of ordinary form, ﬁrst two segments taken together shorter than or as long as tibia; hind basitarsus of male much more slender than tibia, parallel-sided",E.
