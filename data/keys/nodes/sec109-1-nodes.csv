sec109-1-1,"Scopa absent; metasoma tapering posteriorly, in the female to a point (Fig. 109-3), suggesting Coelioxys; metepisternum almost linear except at upper end (Fig. 109-2a), pits united to form one large pit; hind tibia with two spurs in female, none in male",Coelioxoides,"Scopa present on hind tibia and basitarsus of female; metasoma not tapering; metepisternum narrow but not linear, pits separate although close together; hind tibia in both sexes with one short, strongly pectinate spur (Fig. 109-2d)","T etrapedia Genus Coelioxoides Cresson Coelioxoides Cresson, 1878: 94. Type species: Coelioxoides punctipennis Cresson, 1878, monobasic. Among apine bees, Coelioxoides can be recognized im- mediately by the Coelioxys-like aspect, particularly of fe- males.  The wings are dark with a hyaline spot or trans- verse band distal to the closed cells (Fig. 109-4). The body length varies from 7.5 to 13.0 mm. Some derived char- acters include the one-segmented maxillary palpus, the enormous sting, and the produced, sharply pointed apex of the metasoma of the female, accentuated by S6, which extends beyond T6 (Fig. 109-3) and forms a nearly closed tube for the sting. Characters that are probably ancestral relative to T etrapediainclude the double (upper and lower) male gonostyli (Fig. 109-5), the complete gono- base, and the presence of a volsella. These features suggest thatCoelioxoides and T etrapediaare sister groups, not that Coelioxoides is derived from T etrapedia. /H18549Coelioxoides occurs from the states of Jalisco and San Luis Potosí in Mexico to Bolivia and the province of Cór- doba, Argentina. The three species were revised by Roig- Alsina (1990). 109. Tribe T etrapediini Figure 109-1. Wings of Tetrapedia",Coelioxoides,
