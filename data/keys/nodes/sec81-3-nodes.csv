sec81-3-1,"Propodeum with narrow horizontal basal zone, set off from declivous posterior surface by a carina, and divided by carinae into a series of large pits (Fig. 81-3); anterior surface of T1 broadly concave and delimited by strong carina; lines delimiting propodeal triangle absent or feeble (holarctic, Mesoamerica)",Heriades,"Propodeum without such a horizontal basal zone (but if pits and a zone set off by a carina are evident, then zone is usually sloping, and anterior surface of T1 is neither broadly concave nor delimited by strong carina); lines delimiting propodeal triangle distinct, at least as sharp changes in sculpturing",sec81-3-2,Heriades,,
sec81-3-2,"Parapsidal lines punctiform (Fig. 81-2a) or at most three times as long as wide; body usually metallic (holarctic, Mesoamerica)",Osmia,Parapsidal lines linear (Fig. 81-2b); body rarely metallic although sometimes strongly so,sec81-3-3,Osmia,,sec81-3-1
sec81-3-3,"Thorax elongate (Fig. 81-6), a line tangent to anterior ends of tegulae is thus near middle of scutum, and ventral proﬁle of mesepisternum, in front of middle coxa, is as long as dorsoventral thickness of thorax (seen in lateral view); apex of marginal cell curving away from wing margin only at extreme apex (Fig. 81-1c); S6 of male fully exposed; labrum of female with few and inconspicuous erect setae, thus often appearing hairless (holarctic)",Chelostoma,"Thorax less elongate (Figs. 81-8, 81-10), a line tangent to anterior ends of tegulae is thus considerably anterior to middle of scutum, and ventral proﬁle of mesepisternum, in front of middle coxa, is much shorter than dorsoventral thickness of thorax; apex of marginal cell usually curving away from wing margin in apical oneeighth or more of cell; S6 of male usually concealed or only its apical margin exposed; labrum of female with numerous erect setae",sec81-3-4,Chelostoma,,sec81-3-2
sec81-3-4,"Posterior lobe of pronotum with several small vertical carinulae parallel to posterior margin; clypeus of female with apical, somewhat spatulate, slender horn (Fig. 8113); T6 of male with median apical rounded ﬂange and broad produced angle laterally (T7 of male not exposed) (palearctic; western North America)",Protosmia,Posterior lobe of pronotum usually without carinulae [but with carinulae in Hoplitis (Alcidamea) pilosifrons (Cresson) and others]; clypeus of female without apical horn; T6 of male not as described above,sec81-3-5,Protosmia,,sec81-3-3
sec81-3-5,"S1 of female with strong preapical bilobed process; S6 of female with median and apical spikes; posterior margins of T1 to T3 gently concave middorsally; S5 of male with deep midapical notch, its margin distally bearing a few capitate hairs (S6 of male without ﬂaps such as are found in Hoplitis, broadly exposed; S1 convex in proﬁle, its anterior surface not deﬁned) (California)",Xeroheriades,"S1 of female without strong preapical process; S6 of female without spikes or rarely with midapical spike; posterior margins of T1 to T3 straight middorsally; S5 of male not deeply notched, without capitate hairs on margin",sec81-3-6,Xeroheriades,,sec81-3-4
sec81-3-6,"S2 and S3 of male similar to one another; S5 and S6 of male hidden, largely membranous, only transverse apical marginal areas and lateral margins somewhat sclerotized, these sterna with large, basal, minutely hairy areas invaginated anteriorly into metasoma; distance from ﬁrst submarginal crossvein to ﬁrst recurrent usually twice distance from second recurrent vein to second submarginal crossvein (Fig. 81-1a); anterior surface of mesepisternum in front of omaulus smooth, shining, lower part usually sharply divided at omaulus from outer surface, lower part of omaulus carinate (except in subgenus Isosmia); male T6 with four strong teeth (Fig. 81-4) (except in subgenus Isosmia) (nearctic)",Ashmeadiella,"S2 and S3 of male commonly quite different from one another; S5 or S6 of male, or both, usually exposed, broadly sclerotized, without large, anterior hairy areas; distance from ﬁrst submarginal crossvein to ﬁrst recurrent almost always less than twice distance from second recurrent vein to second submarginal crossvein; anterior surface of mesepisternum in front of omaulus usually with at least a few punctures near omaulus, which is not carinate; male T6 not four-toothed",sec81-3-7,Ashmeadiella,,sec81-3-5
