Type species: Ancyla oraniensis Lepeletier, 1841, monobasic. Plistotrichia Morawitz, 1874: 134. Type species: Nomia ﬂavi- labris Lucas, 1846 /H11005Ancyla oraniensisLepeletier, 1841, monobasic. Ancyla is extraordinary among L-T bees in that the glossa and labial palpi are short (Fig. 107-2), the mouth- parts thus suggesting those of the Melittidae. The labial palpi are robust, little longer than the glossa, and the sec- ond segment is but little longer than the third (Silveira, 1993a), an unusual character for an L-T bee. Nonethe- less,Ancylahas basic features of L-T bees, such as the pres- ence of a stipital comb and the lack of a galeal comb; pre- sumably, the short glossa and labial palpi result from reduction, possibly in response to regular use of shallow ﬂowers such as those of Apiaceae. Silveira (1993a) de- scribed these and other characters of the mouthparts. The body length is 5 to 10 mm. The male genitalia were illus- trated by Silveira (1995a, b). /H18549Ancyla is found in the Mediterranean area from Spain (one specimen) and Morocco east through northern 685 107.
