sec39-5-1,"Mandible of male with large tooth or process on lowermargin; clypeus of female without or with weakly differentiated, closely punctate, upper median area; the lateral and apical clypeal areas, if differentiated, then merely less closely punctate than upper median area",sec39-5-2,"Mandible of male often with obtuse preapical angle on lower margin but without large tooth or process; clypeus of female with ﬂat or depressed, relatively closely punctate, upper median area contrasting with impunctate or sparsely punctate, convex, U-shaped lateral and apical region",sec39-5-3,,,
sec39-5-2,"Preapical tooth of male mandible enormous, separated from apical part of mandible (rutellum) by curved emargination (Fig. 39-9g); S8 of male with apical process downcurved, apex expanded and quadrangular; mandible of female unusually slender, preapical (pollex) tooth weakly developed (Fig. 39-9f)",L. (Ctenosibyne),"Preapical tooth of male mandible absent; S8 of male with apical process short, pointed, scarcely downcurved; mandible of female more robust with well-developed preapical tooth",L. (Lonchopria s. str.),L. (Ctenosibyne),L. (Lonchopria s. str.),sec39-5-1
sec39-5-3,"Glossa deeply biﬁd (Fig. 39-12b), each lobe longer than prementum; apex of mandible scoop-shaped, the preapical (pollex) tooth reduced in female, absent in male",L. (Porterapis),"Glossa of the usual bilobed form (sometimes rather deeply so), each lobe less than one-third length of prementum; apex of mandible pointed, preapical tooth (which is sometimes double) usually strong",sec39-5-4,L. (Porterapis),,sec39-5-1
sec39-5-4,"Tibial scopal hairs sparse (as in Leioproctus), not hiding tibial surface, which is therefore not greatly different from that of basitarsus; body length 7.5-9.0 mm; jugal lobe of hind wing reaching or surpassing vein cu-v, over two-thirds as long as vannal lobe measured from wing base",L. (Lonchoprella),"Tibial scopal hairs extremely dense, hiding tibial surface, which therefore contrasts strongly with more sparsely haired basitarsus; body length variable but in most species over 9 mm; jugal lobe of hind wing usually not reaching vein cu-v and usually less than two-thirds as long as vannal lobe",L.
