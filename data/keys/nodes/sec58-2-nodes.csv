Danforth (1991a) retained them in the genus Perdita but showed that they constitute the sis- ter group of Perdita as it is here understood. In addition to the characters indicated in the key to subgenera, Macrotera has the following features. The stigma is slen- der, little if any broader than the prestigma, as measured to the wing margin, its margin within the marginal cell not or scarcely convex (Fig. 58-2a); the paraglossae of fe- males are expanded into broad, brushlike apices; the body is nonmetallic, the yellow maculation usually ab- sent except on the face, although the body may be honey- colored and the metasoma, at least of males, is com- monly reddish; and the head of the male tends to be broad and quadrate, often highly variable in size within a population (Figs. 58-3, 58-4). Interestingly, the male genitalia and hidden sterna do not differ markedly be- tween Macrotera and Perdita; as shown in Figure 58-7, the hidden sterna of Macrotera resemble those of some groups of Perdita. Some interesting behavioral plesiomorphies retained by Macrotera and unknown in Perdita include the fol- lowing. In species of Macrotera that have been studied, the cells are lined with a water-repellant secretion, as in most ground-nesting bees; in Perditathe cells are very in- completely lined or not lined at all. In Macrotera, how- ever, the pollen ball in each cell is not covered by a water- repellent secretion, whereas in Perdita, which lacks the cell lining, the food mass is so covered. In Macrotera the feces of larvae are applied to the inner part of the cell, as in many other ground-nesting bees, including other Pa- nurginae. In Perdita the feces of larvae are deposited on the venter of the larva, and thus kept away from the cell wall, possibly keeping them dry and reducing their po- tential as a source of fungal development. References to literature on these topics are listed under the tribe Perdi- tini. Key to the Subgenera of Macrotera 1. Facial fovea well developed and elongate; head of male usually enlarged, subquadrate, wider than long, inner or- bits more or less divergent below; head of female as long as wide or slightly longer than wide; marginal cell about three times as long as wide, subequal in length to ﬁrst sub- marginal cell .................................................................. 2",Perdita,,
