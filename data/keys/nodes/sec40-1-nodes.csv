sec40-1-1,"T1 with anterior surface not broadly concave, often with a longitudinal median concavity; dorsal surface of T1 about as long as exposed part of T2 and at least two-thirds as long as anterior surface of T1, as seen in proﬁle; second recurrent vein usually sigmoid with posterior half arcuate distad (Fig. 40-3), rarely angulate distad at alar fenestra on ﬂexion line; base of propodeum with short, subhorizontal to vertical basal zone usually deﬁned posteriorly by a carina (Fig. 37-3) or exhibiting a sharp change in slope or sculpture and divided by longitudinal carinae that may delimit strong pits (worldwide except Indo-Australian region)",Colletes,"T1 with anterior surface broadly concave; dorsal surface of T1 much shorter than exposed part of T2 and less than two-thirds as long as anterior surface of T1, as seen in proﬁle; second recurrent vein with posterior half straight or gently arcuate (as in Fig. 39-5), its anterior part not curved in the reverse direction, vein thus not sigmoid; base of propodeum with sloping basal zone nearly smooth, not traversed by longitudinal carinae (South America)",Mourecotelles,Colletes,Mourecotelles
