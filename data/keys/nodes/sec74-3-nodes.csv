Macropis / Subgenus Macropis Panzer s. str. Macropis Panzer, 1809, no. 16. Type species: Megilla labiata Fabricius, 1805 /H11005Megilla fulvipes Fabricius, 1805, monobasic. [Macropis has been attributed to Klug, but as pointed out in Commission Opinion 1383 (1986), Panzer provided the description.] For a consideration of the name Megilla Fabricius (1804) and its relation to the name Macropis, see Mich- ener (1983b, 1984) and Commission Opinion 1383 (1986). /H18549This is a holarctic subgenus found in mesic (not xeric) regions from western Europe to Japan and in eastern and central North America, from Quebec, Canada, to Geor- gia and west to Montana and Colorado, with more west- ern records in Idaho and Washington state, USA. This subgenus contains ten species. A key to palearctic species of the genus was given by Wu (1965a), to western palearc- tic species by Warncke (1973a), and to North American species by Snelling and Stage (1995a). See also Michez and Patiny (2005). Nesting biology of species of this subgenus has been described by Malyshev (1929), Rozen and Jacobson (1980), and Cane et al. (1983). Macropis / Subgenus Paramacropis Popov  and Guiglia ParamacropisPopov and Guiglia, 1936: 287. Type species: Ctenoplectra ussuriana Popov, 1936, monobasic. The status of this subgenus was reviewed by Wu and Michener (1986), who described the female for the ﬁrst time and veriﬁed the position of Paramacropis in the genus Macropis. The lone species possesses striking pre- sumably plesiomorphic characters as compared to other species of Macropis, such as the simple male gonostylus and the simple hind basitarsus of the male. At the same time it has highly derived features, such as the male S7 and S8 (see the key to the subgenera). The male genitalia were illustrated by Popov (1936b) and Wu and Michener (1986). /H18549This subgenus is from northeastern China and the Pa- ciﬁc maritime province of Russia. The only species is Macropis ussuriana(Popov). No observations have been made on the ﬂoral behav- ior of Paramacropis,but the female possesses oil-manipu- lating and -transporting structures like those of other Macropis. Presumably, Paramacropisuses oil from ﬂowers of Lysimachia, as do the other subgenera. Macropis / Subgenus Sinomacropis Michener Macropis (Sinomacropis) Michener, 1981a: 51. Type species: Macropis hedini Alfken, 1936, by original designation.  Sinomacropis is widespread in China and occurs in Laos but is not known from other countries. See a key by Wu (1965a) and a review of the subgenus by Wu and Michener (1986); all four species were reviewed by Michez and Patiny (2005). The ﬂoral biology was considered by Wu (1965a); the relation of Sinomacropis to Lysimachia appears to be the same as that for Macropis s. str. Genus Melitta Kirby These are melittine bees superﬁcially resembling species ofAndrena; the body length is 8 to 15 mm. The labrum has a lateral apical lobe, a character not found in other bees. The mouthparts are otherwise ordinary for the group except in the subgenus Dolichochile. The scopa on the outer sides of the hind tibia and basitarsus of the fe- male is simple, these segments being slender. The propodeal triangle is large, dull. S7 of the male has a large disc and insigniﬁcant lateral apical lobes. The volsella has a long, blunt process extending much posterior to the cus- pis and not opposable to it. The male genitalia were sketched by Warncke (1973a) and illustrated along with the hidden sterna by Wu (1978, 1982b), Michener (1981a), and Snelling and Stage (1995b); see also Figure 74-2d-f. I reluctantly list two subgenera of Melitta below, for recognition of Dolichochile makes Melitta s. str. in its pre- sent sense paraphyletic. Dolichochile is phenetically re- markable, and I hope that its recognition will encourage investigators to learn the biological signiﬁcance of its strange mandibular and proboscidial characters. What is needed is a cladistic study of all species of Melitta to de- termine the real relationships of M. (Dolichochile) melit- toides (Viereck). Then, since it is similar to Melitta except for a few remarkable features, the most informative clas- siﬁcation might place M. melittoides within some species group of Melitta. Key to the Subgenera of Melitta 1. Maxillary palpus reduced to two short, fused segments (Fig. 74-1e); mandible of female slightly longer than eye, distal half a long, ﬂat, pointed blade, at base of which on inner side are two small teeth (Fig. 74-3); surface of labrum rather uniformly convex, impunctate except near  apical margin (nearctic) ........................
