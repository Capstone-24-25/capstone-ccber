sec39-1-2,"Malar space nearly as long as or longer than eye; S8 of male weakly sclerotized, lacking apical process (Fig. 3913c) (Ecuador)",Lonchorhyncha,"Malar space little if any longer than ﬂagellar width, usually virtually absent; S8 of male with strong median apical process",sec39-1-3,Lonchorhyncha,,sec39-1-1
sec39-1-3,"Labial palpi enormous, 8-9 mm long, in repose reaching S3 or S4; claws of both sexes deeply cleft, the two rami similar in shape and of almost equal length (Brazil)",Niltonia,"Labial palpi unremarkable; claws with inner rami shorter than outer and differently shaped, at least in female, or, rarely, claws simple",sec39-1-4,Niltonia,,sec39-1-2
sec39-1-4,"Forewing with three submarginal cells, second usually about as long as third on posterior margin (but see subgenus Lonchoprias. str.); apical process of S8 of male lacking ﬂat apical region resembling a pygidial plate; inner hind tibial spur of female coarsely palmate-pectinate, bases of teeth close together and diverging from thick part of spur (Fig. 39-8e); tibial scopa (except in subgenus Lonchoprella) extremely dense, hiding tibial surface; hind basitarsus of female weakly concave on outer surface near upper margin, this surface unlike that of tibia in appearance, the surface easily visible among hairs that are usually shorter than those of inner surface (South America)",Lonchopria,"Forewing with two or three submarginal cells, if with three, then second much shorter than third on posterior margin (except in Leioproctus subgenus Cephalocolletes and most specimens of subgenus Reedapis); apical process of S8 of male with ﬂat, bare apical region on upper side, superﬁcially resembling a pygidial plate and usually exposed at apex of metasoma; inner hind tibial spur of female ciliate to coarsely pectinate, not at all palmate and not thickened medially; scopa not hiding tibial surface; hind basitarsus of female ﬂat or convex on outer surface, this surface superﬁcially similar to that of tibia, its hairs longer than those of inner surface (ignoring hairs of upper margin)",sec39-1-5,Lonchopria,,sec39-1-3
