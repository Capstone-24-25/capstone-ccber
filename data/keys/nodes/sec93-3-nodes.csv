(Melanomada) Brachynomada / Subgenus Brachynomada Holmberg s. str. Brachynomada Holmberg, 1886b: 233, 239, 272. Type species: Brachynomada argentina Holmberg, 1886, desig- nated by Sandhouse, 1943: 531. /H18549This subgenus occurs from Peru and the state of São Paulo, Brazil, to the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Probable members of this subgenus are reported from ar- eas as distant as Ceará, Brazil, and Mendoza, Argentina, but I have not seen specimens from such distant areas; they might belong to similar-looking bees such as Tri- chonomada. Eight species have been described. Several species of this subgenus were misplaced in Doeringiella (Epeolini) by Friese (1908b), who gave a key to certain species. Species of Brachynomada s. str. are cleptoparasites of Exomalopsis (Exomalopsini), as shown by Rozen (1997a), and Psaenythia(Panurginae), as shown by Rozen (1994b). The use of such dissimilar hosts, belonging to different families of bees, is of interest. The larva of B. scotti Rozen was described by Rozen (1997a). Brachynomada / Subgenus Melanomada Cockerell Nomada (Melanomada)Cockerell, 1903d: 587. Type species: Nomada grindeliae Cockerell, 1903, by original designa- tion. Hesperonomada Linsley, 1939b: 5. Type species: Hesperono- mada melanantha Linsley, 1939, by original designation. /H18549Brachynomada (Melanomada) occurs from California and Nebraska south to T exas, USA, and Durango and Jalisco, Mexico. The seven species were revised by Snelling and Rozen (1987), supplemented by Rozen (1994b). Species of Melanomada are cleptoparasites in nests of Anthophorula (Anthophorisca) (Exomalopsini) (Rozen, 1977b, 1997a; Rozen and Snelling, 1986). Host records are summarized by Snelling and Rozen (1987), supple- mented by Rozen (1994b, 1997a). Genus Kelita Sandhouse This is a distinctive genus of Brachynomadini, as indi- cated by the ﬁrst couplet of the key to genera. Moreover, the antennal scape is not ﬂattened as it is in the other gen- era, and the species are often smaller, the body length be- ing from 2.8 to 5.8 mm. The pseudopygidial area is partly covered by broad, scalelike, posteriorly directed, ap- pressed hairs; in all other Brachynomadini the hairs are slender and directed posterolaterally. Key to the Subgenera of Kelita (From Rozen, 1997a) 1. Submarginal cells two; maxillary palpus six-segmented; hind tibia of male normal in shape; hind tibial spurs of male normal in size, subequal in length; dorsal and me- dian processes of gonostylus shorter than gonocoxite  (Chile) ....................................................K.
