The midfacial prominence is al- most always present in females, absent in most males. The labial palpus is four-segmented except in certain Old World species that lack the fourth segment. The fore and middle tibiae in the female each have two longitu- dinal rows of coarse spicules or tubercles extending basad, on the posterior part of the outer surface, from each of the two apical tibial spines, these rows outlining a channel on each tibia that extends basad to the middle of the tibia or beyond, sometimes nearly to the base. There are sometimes some spicules between the rows. In males the spicules are smaller, the rows shorter, some- times absent. Scattered over the short-haired outer sur- face of the hind tibia of the female are coarse tubercles (Fig. 80-3b); the tubercles of the males are smaller, ab- sent in many species. The wing membrane is hairy, of- ten densely so. The pygidial plate of the female is a flat or concave dorsal surface of a long apical spine of T6 (Fig. 80-2c); of the male, it is a dorsally concave, broad, blunt projection or robust spine (Fig. 80-4a). The male genitalia and hidden sterna were illustrated by Mitchell (1960), Michener (1983a), and van der Zanden (1986); see also Figure 80-4c-e. This genus is worldwide in distribution in tropical and warm to moderate temperate zones, except that in the Americas it may be largely absent from the wet tropics. T wo subgenera are commonly recognized. Key to the Subgenera of Lithurgus 1. Arolia absent or rudimentary in both sexes (except pre- sent in male of L. rubricatusSmith from Australia); facial prominence of female involving upper part of clypeus and usually also part of supraclypeal area; ﬁrst ﬂagellar segment about twice as long as broad, more than twice as long as second, which is much broader than long .......... ..........................................................
