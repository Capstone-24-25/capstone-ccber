sec67-10-1,Inner hind tibial spur of female pectinate with over ten close teeth (as in Fig. 67-5n); paraocular lobe slightly acute; male gonostylus undivided,C. (Ischnomelissa),"Inner hind tibial spur of female with fewer, well-separated teeth (as in Fig. 67-5i); paraocular lobe strongly acute; male gonostylus divided into dorsal and ventral processes","C. (Chlerogella s. str.) Chlerogella / Subgenus Chlerogella Michener s. str. Chlerogella Michener, 1954b: 75. Type species: Chlerogella elongaticeps Michener, 1954, by original designation. Most species of this subgenus are largely testaceous. The dorsally convex pronotum, with convexities replac- ing the dorsolateral angles, is usually more prominent than in Ischnomelissa. Body length is 6 to 8 mm. /H18549This subgenus ranges from Peru to Costa Rica, in the mountains. Three published names are associated with the subgenus (Moure and Hurd, 1987), and about 15 ad- ditional species are in a manuscript by M. Engel and R. Brooks. Chlerogella / Subgenus Ischnomelissa Engel Ischnomelissa Engel, 1997c: 42. Type species: Ischnomelissa zonata Engel, 1997, by original designation. The name Ischnomelissawas given to a group of species that resemble Chlerogella in most features but differ in the characters given in the key to subgenera, and in their gen- erally dark color, dark blue-green or with the metasoma black. T wo species lack malar areas, whereas others have malar areas about as long as broad. The body length is 6.5 to 10.0 mm. /H18549This subgenus occurs in the Andes from Colombia to Peru. Seven species have been described, and keys were provided by Brooks and Engel (1998) and Engel and Brooks (2000). Genus Chlerogelloides Engel, Brooks, and Yanega Chlerogelloides Engel, Brooks, and Yanega, 1997: 3. Type species: Chlerogelloides femoralis Engel, Brooks, and Yanega, 1997, by original designation. In size (5.4-7.0 mm body length), form, coloration, and the elongate form of the head, Chlerogelloides resembles species of Chlerogellas. str. The cephalic elongation is pro- duced by the greatly lengthened clypeus and supraclypeal region (Fig. 67-13a) in Chlerogelloides,whereas in both ChlerogasandChlerogellathe elongation involves the greatly lengthened malar spaces. Both Chlerogellas. str. and Chlero- gelloidesshare a peculiar inﬂation of the pronotal dorsal sur- face, this surface being glabrous or ﬁnely imbricate. Chlero- gelloidescan be seprated from Chlerogellaby the short malar space, the serrate inner hind tibial spur of the female, the unique sharply pointed and slender paraocular lobes, and the slender proboscis, as in Megommation.Although the proboscis is long, the prementum being about as long as the head, the proboscidial fossa is not so narrow as in Megom- mationand the slenderness of the proboscis is probably not homologous to that of Megommation.One of the strangest features of Chlerogelloides is the long, toothless male mandible, its distal two-ﬁfths strongly bent mesad and ex- tremely attenuate, the apex compressed and blunt. /H18549Chlerogelloides is found in the state of Amazonas, Brazil, and adjacent parts of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and French Guiana. T wo species are known. Genus Corynura Spinola This genus contains diverse-looking elements, from bril- liant green to dull metallic or black, the metasoma some- times red. The body length is 6 to 11 mm. The lack of paraocular lobes is shown in Figure 67-6a, and male gen- italia in Figure 65-1l, m. The mouthparts are as described forHalictillus. The metasoma of males is petiolate or at least elongate. The nests of both subgenera of Corynura were de- scribed and illustrated by Claude-Joseph (1926); see also Sakagami and Michener (1962). The cells, which range from horizontal to almost vertical, are in clusters. The females of the two subgenera come out at differ- ent places in the key to genera because in Corynura s. str. the inner hind tibial spur is serrate, whereas in Callis- tochlora it is strongly pectinate. Key to the Subgenera of Corynura 1.
