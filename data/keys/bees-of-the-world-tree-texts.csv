43,"Key to the Subgenera of Andrena of the Western
Palearctic Region (Females)
(Modiﬁed from A. Molino-Pardo’s translation (MS) of
Warncke’s 1968 key)
The subgenus Oreomelissa, containing the European
Andrena coitana(Kirby), is omitted from the key to males,
but see the key to Japanese subgenera. Warncke (1968)
placed this species in Stenomelissa but neither described
that subgenus nor placed it in his key. It presumably has
nothing to do with the east Asian Stenomelissa Hirashima
and LaBerge. Although Carinandrena, Fuscandrena,
Leimelissa, Longandrena, Osychnyukandrena, and Pla-
niandrena are palearctic taxa, they not included in this
key. Four of them are monotypic. Malayapis is included,
although it is oriental. For couplet 17, see also couplet 49;
the subgenus Holandrenawould seemingly run to couplet
18. In Warncke’s key these couplet numbers are 17 and
48, respectively.

Genus Macrotera Smith
Macrotera consists of four subgenera commonly placed
in the genus Perdita. Danforth (1991a) retained them in
the genus Perdita but showed that they constitute the sis-
ter group of Perdita as it is here understood. In addition
to the characters indicated in the key to subgenera,
Macrotera has the following features. The stigma is slen-
der, little if any broader than the prestigma, as measured
to the wing margin, its margin within the marginal cell
not or scarcely convex (Fig. 58-2a); the paraglossae of fe-
males are expanded into broad, brushlike apices; the
body is nonmetallic, the yellow maculation usually ab-
sent except on the face, although the body may be honey-
colored and the metasoma, at least of males, is com-
monly reddish; and the head of the male tends to be
broad and quadrate, often highly variable in size within
a population (Figs. 58-3, 58-4). Interestingly, the male
genitalia and hidden sterna do not differ markedly be-
tween Macrotera and Perdita; as shown in Figure 58-7,
the hidden sterna of Macrotera resemble those of some
groups of Perdita.
Some interesting behavioral plesiomorphies retained
by Macrotera and unknown in Perdita include the fol-
lowing. In species of Macrotera that have been studied,
the cells are lined with a water-repellant secretion, as in
most ground-nesting bees; in Perditathe cells are very in-
completely lined or not lined at all. In Macrotera, how-
ever, the pollen ball in each cell is not covered by a water-
repellent secretion, whereas in Perdita, which lacks the
cell lining, the food mass is so covered. In Macrotera the
feces of larvae are applied to the inner part of the cell, as
in many other ground-nesting bees, including other Pa-
nurginae. In Perdita the feces of larvae are deposited on
the venter of the larva, and thus kept away from the cell
wall, possibly keeping them dry and reducing their po-
tential as a source of fungal development. References to
literature on these topics are listed under the tribe Perdi-
tini.

Chlerogella / Subgenus Chlerogella Michener s. str.
Chlerogella Michener, 1954b: 75. Type species: Chlerogella
elongaticeps Michener, 1954, by original designation.
Most species of this subgenus are largely testaceous.
The dorsally convex pronotum, with convexities replac-
ing the dorsolateral angles, is usually more prominent
than in Ischnomelissa. Body length is 6 to 8 mm.
/H18549This subgenus ranges from Peru to Costa Rica, in the
mountains. Three published names are associated with
the subgenus (Moure and Hurd, 1987), and about 15 ad-
ditional species are in a manuscript by M. Engel and R.
Brooks.

that resemble Chlerogella in most features but differ in the
characters given in the key to subgenera, and in their gen-
erally dark color, dark blue-green or with the metasoma
black. T wo species lack malar areas, whereas others have
malar areas about as long as broad. The body length is 6.5
to 10.0 mm.
/H18549This subgenus occurs in the Andes from Colombia to
Peru. Seven species have been described, and keys were
provided by Brooks and Engel (1998) and Engel and
Brooks (2000).
Genus Chlerogelloides Engel, Brooks, and Yanega
Chlerogelloides Engel, Brooks, and Yanega, 1997: 3. Type
species: Chlerogelloides femoralis Engel, Brooks, and
Yanega, 1997, by original designation.
In size (5.4-7.0 mm body length), form, coloration, and
the elongate form of the head, Chlerogelloides resembles
species of Chlerogellas. str. The cephalic elongation is pro-
duced by the greatly lengthened clypeus and supraclypeal
region (Fig. 67-13a) in Chlerogelloides,whereas in both
ChlerogasandChlerogellathe elongation involves the greatly
lengthened malar spaces. Both Chlerogellas. str. and Chlero-
gelloidesshare a peculiar inﬂation of the pronotal dorsal sur-
face, this surface being glabrous or ﬁnely imbricate. Chlero-
gelloidescan be seprated from Chlerogellaby the short malar
space, the serrate inner hind tibial spur of the female, the
unique sharply pointed and slender paraocular lobes, and
the slender proboscis, as in Megommation.Although the
proboscis is long, the prementum being about as long as the
head, the proboscidial fossa is not so narrow as in Megom-
mationand the slenderness of the proboscis is probably not
homologous to that of Megommation.One of the strangest
features of Chlerogelloides is the long, toothless male
mandible, its distal two-ﬁfths strongly bent mesad and ex-
tremely attenuate, the apex compressed and blunt.
/H18549Chlerogelloides is found in the state of Amazonas,
Brazil, and adjacent parts of Peru, Ecuador, Colombia,
and French Guiana. T wo species are known.
Genus Corynura Spinola
This genus contains diverse-looking elements, from bril-
liant green to dull metallic or black, the metasoma some-
times red. The body length is 6 to 11 mm. The lack of
paraocular lobes is shown in Figure 67-6a, and male gen-
italia in Figure 65-1l, m. The mouthparts are as described
forHalictillus. The metasoma of males is petiolate or at
least elongate.
The nests of both subgenera of Corynura were de-
scribed and illustrated by Claude-Joseph (1926); see also
Sakagami and Michener (1962). The cells, which range
from horizontal to almost vertical, are in clusters.
The females of the two subgenera come out at differ-
ent places in the key to genera because in Corynura s. str.
the inner hind tibial spur is serrate, whereas in Callis-
tochlora it is strongly pectinate.

monobasic. [Macropis has been attributed to Klug, but as
pointed out in Commission Opinion 1383 (1986), Panzer
provided the description.]
For a consideration of the name Megilla Fabricius
(1804) and its relation to the name Macropis, see Mich-
ener (1983b, 1984) and Commission Opinion 1383
(1986).
/H18549This is a holarctic subgenus found in mesic (not xeric)
regions from western Europe to Japan and in eastern and
central North America, from Quebec, Canada, to Geor-
gia and west to Montana and Colorado, with more west-
ern records in Idaho and Washington state, USA. This
subgenus contains ten species. A key to palearctic species
of the genus was given by Wu (1965a), to western palearc-
tic species by Warncke (1973a), and to North American
species by Snelling and Stage (1995a). See also Michez
and Patiny (2005).
Nesting biology of species of this subgenus has been
described by Malyshev (1929), Rozen and Jacobson
(1980), and Cane et al. (1983).
Macropis / Subgenus Paramacropis Popov 
and Guiglia
ParamacropisPopov and Guiglia, 1936: 287. Type species:
Ctenoplectra ussuriana Popov, 1936, monobasic.
The status of this subgenus was reviewed by Wu and
Michener (1986), who described the female for the ﬁrst
time and veriﬁed the position of Paramacropis in the
genus Macropis. The lone species possesses striking pre-
sumably plesiomorphic characters as compared to other
species of Macropis, such as the simple male gonostylus
and the simple hind basitarsus of the male. At the same
time it has highly derived features, such as the male S7
and S8 (see the key to the subgenera). The male genitalia
were illustrated by Popov (1936b) and Wu and Michener
(1986).
/H18549This subgenus is from northeastern China and the Pa-
ciﬁc maritime province of Russia. The only species is
Macropis ussuriana(Popov).
No observations have been made on the ﬂoral behav-
ior of Paramacropis,but the female possesses oil-manipu-
lating and -transporting structures like those of other
Macropis. Presumably, Paramacropisuses oil from ﬂowers
of Lysimachia, as do the other subgenera.
Macropis / Subgenus Sinomacropis Michener
Macropis (Sinomacropis) Michener, 1981a: 51. Type species:
Macropis hedini Alfken, 1936, by original designation. 
Sinomacropis is widespread in China and occurs in
Laos but is not known from other countries. See a key by
Wu (1965a) and a review of the subgenus by Wu and
Michener (1986); all four species were reviewed by
Michez and Patiny (2005).
The ﬂoral biology was considered by Wu (1965a); the
relation of Sinomacropis to Lysimachia appears to be the
same as that for Macropis s. str.

group except in the subgenus Dolichochile. The scopa on
the outer sides of the hind tibia and basitarsus of the fe-
male is simple, these segments being slender. The
propodeal triangle is large, dull. S7 of the male has a large
disc and insigniﬁcant lateral apical lobes. The volsella has
a long, blunt process extending much posterior to the cus-
pis and not opposable to it. The male genitalia were
sketched by Warncke (1973a) and illustrated along with
the hidden sterna by Wu (1978, 1982b), Michener
(1981a), and Snelling and Stage (1995b); see also Figure
74-2d-f.
I reluctantly list two subgenera of Melitta below, for
recognition of Dolichochile makes Melitta s. str. in its pre-
sent sense paraphyletic. Dolichochile is phenetically re-
markable, and I hope that its recognition will encourage
investigators to learn the biological signiﬁcance of its
strange mandibular and proboscidial characters. What is
needed is a cladistic study of all species of Melitta to de-
termine the real relationships of M. (Dolichochile) melit-
toides (Viereck). Then, since it is similar to Melitta except
for a few remarkable features, the most informative clas-
siﬁcation might place M. melittoides within some species
group of Melitta.

Genus Lithurgus Berthold
Bees of this genus, 8 to 19 mm long, are robust, sug-
gesting a slightly elongated Megachile,but the metasoma
is somewhat flattened, and commonly has apical tergal
and sternal hair bands. The midfacial prominence is al-
most always present in females, absent in most males.
The labial palpus is four-segmented except in certain
Old World species that lack the fourth segment. The fore
and middle tibiae in the female each have two longitu-
dinal rows of coarse spicules or tubercles extending
basad, on the posterior part of the outer surface, from
each of the two apical tibial spines, these rows outlining
a channel on each tibia that extends basad to the middle
of the tibia or beyond, sometimes nearly to the base.
There are sometimes some spicules between the rows. In
males the spicules are smaller, the rows shorter, some-
times absent. Scattered over the short-haired outer sur-
face of the hind tibia of the female are coarse tubercles
(Fig. 80-3b); the tubercles of the males are smaller, ab-
sent in many species. The wing membrane is hairy, of-
ten densely so. The pygidial plate of the female is a flat
or concave dorsal surface of a long apical spine of T6
(Fig. 80-2c); of the male, it is a dorsally concave, broad,
blunt projection or robust spine (Fig. 80-4a). The male
genitalia and hidden sterna were illustrated by Mitchell
(1960), Michener (1983a), and van der Zanden (1986);
see also Figure 80-4c-e.
This genus is worldwide in distribution in tropical and
warm to moderate temperate zones, except that in the
Americas it may be largely absent from the wet tropics.
T wo subgenera are commonly recognized.

species: Brachynomada argentina Holmberg, 1886, desig-
nated by Sandhouse, 1943: 531.
/H18549This subgenus occurs from Peru and the state of São
Paulo, Brazil, to the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Probable members of this subgenus are reported from ar-
eas as distant as Ceará, Brazil, and Mendoza, Argentina,
but I have not seen specimens from such distant areas;
they might belong to similar-looking bees such as Tri-
chonomada. Eight species have been described. Several
species of this subgenus were misplaced in Doeringiella
(Epeolini) by Friese (1908b), who gave a key to certain
species.
Species of Brachynomada s. str. are cleptoparasites of
Exomalopsis (Exomalopsini), as shown by Rozen (1997a),
and Psaenythia(Panurginae), as shown by Rozen (1994b).
The use of such dissimilar hosts, belonging to different
families of bees, is of interest. The larva of B. scotti Rozen
was described by Rozen (1997a).

/H18549Brachynomada (Melanomada) occurs from California
and Nebraska south to T exas, USA, and Durango and
Jalisco, Mexico. The seven species were revised by
Snelling and Rozen (1987), supplemented by Rozen

Species of Melanomada are cleptoparasites in nests of
Anthophorula (Anthophorisca) (Exomalopsini) (Rozen,
1977b, 1997a; Rozen and Snelling, 1986). Host records
are summarized by Snelling and Rozen (1987), supple-
mented by Rozen (1994b, 1997a).
Genus Kelita Sandhouse
This is a distinctive genus of Brachynomadini, as indi-
cated by the ﬁrst couplet of the key to genera. Moreover,
the antennal scape is not ﬂattened as it is in the other gen-
era, and the species are often smaller, the body length be-
ing from 2.8 to 5.8 mm. The pseudopygidial area is partly
covered by broad, scalelike, posteriorly directed, ap-
pressed hairs; in all other Brachynomadini the hairs are
slender and directed posterolaterally.

....................................................................Epeolus group
The Trophocleptria group differs from the Epeolus
group not only in the characters listed in the key above,
but also in the larger stigma and the longer marginal cell,
typically longer than the distance from its apex to the
wing tip. These wing characters suggest the very different
genusOdyneropsis. Epeolus bifasciatus Cresson, the only
Trophocleptria in temperate North America, is interme-
diate in wing characters. It also has areas of white pubes-
cence on the metasoma that are poorly developed in other
species. It was regarded as intermediate between Epeolus
s. str. and Trophocleptriaby Michener (1954b). Male gen-
italia and hidden sterna of the Trophocleptriagroup were
illustrated by Michener (1954b) and Rightmyer (2004).
/H18549The Epeolus group occurs across the entire holarctic re-
gion, north to the latitudes of subarctic Alaska and Fin-
land, from coast to coast in North America, and in the
Eastern Hemisphere from the Canary Islands, Portugal,
and Britain to Japan. Southward, the Epeolus group is not
known from tropical India or southeast Asia but occurs
through Africa to the Cape and through the Americas to
Cuba, Central America, and Colombia. About 55 species
are known from North and Central America, about 35
from the palearctic region, and 11 from sub-Saharan
Africa. The species of western North America were re-
vised by Brumley (1965), those of sub-Saharan Africa
were revised by Eardley (1991b). Yasumatsu (1933) and
Hirashima (1955) gave keys to Japanese species; Bischoff
(1930) and Lith (1956) gave accounts of palearctic
species. Richards (1937) revised British species and gave
an extensive account of the relations of those species and
their morphs to their Colletes hosts.
/H18549The Trophocleptria group occurs from Connecticut,
Minnesota, and Colorado, USA, south through the trop-
ics to the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are
about eight species.
Genus Odyneropsis Schrottky
Odyneropsis consists of moderate-sized to rather large
(body length, 9 to 17 mm), slender species without areas
of white, appressed pubescence, except sometimes on the
pronotum, propodeum, and anterior surface of T1. The
entire body is sericeous because of short, appressed,
brown hairs. The body shape and long wings cause large
species to closely resemble Polistes wasps, and some
species have yellowish areas reinforcing the resemblance.
An unusual feature is the near absence of the maxillary
palpus in most species of Odyneropsis s. str.; it is probably
represented by a minute subspherical body in approxi-
mately the position of the palpus. By contrast, Moure
(1955) observed one specimen with three segments on
one side, only the basal one on the other, and some species
of the subgenus Parammobates have three segments. The
pseudopygidial area of T5 of the female is rather large,
covered with dark hairs, and the posterior margin has a
broad notch, from the apex of which a narrow, smooth,
shining, longitudinal line extends forward, bisecting the
area. This line is posterior to the median depression of T5,
which is surrounded by a ridge (absent anteriorly in the
subgenusParammobates). The structure of T5 suggests
that of Rhogepeolus, which, however, is a much more or-
dinary epeoline. Unlike that of Rhogepeolus, the frontal
carina is strong along the summit of the interantennal
prominence. S6 of the female has a relatively broad disc,
as in Epeolusand Rhogepeolus; the apicolateral process is
hairy and bears at its apex a row of curved, thickened se-
tae, enlarged and broadened at their blunt apices. Illus-
trations of numerous structures were provided by Right-
myer (2004).

Genus Anthophorula Cockerell
This genus has usually been included in Exomalopsis but
was differentiated by Silveira (1995a, b). In addition to
the characters indicated in the key to genera, it differs
from Exomalopsis in having the areas between the ocelli
and the eyes convex. The stigma is commonly smaller
than in Exomalopsis, less than half as long as the length of
the marginal cell on the wing margin, but this character
is consistent only for the subgenus Anthophorula s. str. In
Anthophorisca the stigma is often as large as in those Exo-
malopsis having smaller stigmas, although never as large
as those in some Exomalopsiss. str. The body length ranges
from 2.5 to 8.0 mm; the smallest species are in the 
subgenusAnthophorula s. str., but one species of An-
thophorisca is only 3.5 mm long. Male genitalia and hid-
den sterna were illustrated by Michener and Moure
(1957), Mitchell (1962), Timberlake (1980b), and Sil-
veira (1995a, b).
As in Exomalopsis but not Eremapis, nests of Antho-
phorula are usually communally occupied burrows, each
being inhabited by several females (Rozen, 1984c). Cells
are oval, with a thin waterproof lining. As in the genus
Exomalopsis,the provision mass is partly lifted off the cell
surface by a projection, called a “foot” by Rozen (1977b,
1984a); it presumably reduces the area of moist contact
between the provision mass and the cell surface, and thus
may reduce the danger of mold. In A. (Anthophorisca)
sidae (Cockerell) and nitens (Cockerell), larvae of the au-
tumn generation spin cocoons, but those of the summer
generation do not (Rozen, 1984a; Rozen and Snelling,
1986), although they retain the cephalic structures char-
acteristic of cocoon-spinning larvae.

Genus Ancyla Lepeletier
Ancyla Lepeletier, 1841: 294. Type species: Ancyla oraniensis
Lepeletier, 1841, monobasic.
Plistotrichia Morawitz, 1874: 134. Type species: Nomia ﬂavi-
labris Lucas, 1846 /H11005Ancyla oraniensisLepeletier, 1841,
monobasic.
Ancyla is extraordinary among L-T bees in that the
glossa and labial palpi are short (Fig. 107-2), the mouth-
parts thus suggesting those of the Melittidae. The labial
palpi are robust, little longer than the glossa, and the sec-
ond segment is but little longer than the third (Silveira,
1993a), an unusual character for an L-T bee. Nonethe-
less,Ancylahas basic features of L-T bees, such as the pres-
ence of a stipital comb and the lack of a galeal comb; pre-
sumably, the short glossa and labial palpi result from
reduction, possibly in response to regular use of shallow
ﬂowers such as those of Apiaceae. Silveira (1993a) de-
scribed these and other characters of the mouthparts. The
body length is 5 to 10 mm. The male genitalia were illus-
trated by Silveira (1995a, b).
/H18549Ancyla is found in the Mediterranean area from Spain

Genus Coelioxoides Cresson
Coelioxoides Cresson, 1878: 94. Type species: Coelioxoides
punctipennis Cresson, 1878, monobasic.
Among apine bees, Coelioxoides can be recognized im-
mediately by the Coelioxys-like aspect, particularly of fe-
males.  The wings are dark with a hyaline spot or trans-
verse band distal to the closed cells (Fig. 109-4). The body
length varies from 7.5 to 13.0 mm. Some derived char-
acters include the one-segmented maxillary palpus, the
enormous sting, and the produced, sharply pointed apex
of the metasoma of the female, accentuated by S6, which
extends beyond T6 (Fig. 109-3) and forms a nearly closed
tube for the sting. Characters that are probably ancestral
relative to T etrapediainclude the double (upper and
lower) male gonostyli (Fig. 109-5), the complete gono-
base, and the presence of a volsella. These features suggest
thatCoelioxoides and T etrapediaare sister groups, not that
Coelioxoides is derived from T etrapedia.
/H18549Coelioxoides occurs from the states of Jalisco and San
Luis Potosí in Mexico to Bolivia and the province of Cór-
doba, Argentina. The three species were revised by Roig-
Alsina (1990).
